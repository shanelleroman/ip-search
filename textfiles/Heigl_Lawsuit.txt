[ANALYSIS] Katherine Heigl Duane Reade Lawsuit to Explore Nature of Corporate Tweets | Hollywood Reporter
Katherine Heigl has been out of the limelight of late, but
thanks to a $6 million lawsuit against Duane Reade, she's
primed to deliver a ruling that could impact how businesses
use social media.



STORY: Katherine Heigl CIA Drama Picked Up to Pilot at
NBC

The actress is upset that the drug store posted on Twitter and
Facebook a paparazzi photo of her carrying the chain's
shopping bags. She's suing in New York federal court with
claims that the defendant has violated the false advertising
provision of the Lanham Act, as well as New York civil rights
statutes protecting use of likenesses for purpose of trade.

Here's a look at the tweet in question:

It's likely that as the case proceeds, Duane Reade will put up a
First Amendment defense that will attempt to protect its social
media postings as expressive rather than commercial speech.
Thus, the nature of how corporations tweet will be subject to a
judge's analysis.

On one hand, it's long been acknowledged that professionals
lean on the medium to promote themselves. On the other,
even corporations can sometimes convey newsworthy
information, and as recent Supreme Court rulings have
suggested, they too have First Amendment rights.

It's not often clear what are the commercial and
noncommercial uses of the Twitter platform.

In Heigl's complaint (read here), she attempts to put Duane
Reade into the realm that's outside the boundaries of free
speech. Her lawyers at Ballard Spahr write:



"Duane Reade's Twitter account normally includes only
occasional Duane Reade products or store premises
photographs displayed as the user scrolls through the Tweet
postings. But among recent photographs, Plaintiﬀs image
stands out as the only celebrity image, thereby designed to
exploit Plaintiﬀs image to suggest false cachet for Defendant's
Twitter page and imply falsely that Plaintiﬀ endorses
Defendant. On information and belief, Defendant has singled
out Plaintiﬀ simply because she happened to be a customer on
one occasion at a Duane Reade store, and a photograph of that
occasion happened to be included in reporting on
entertainment-industry news."

The commercial or noncommercial aspect of Duane Reade's
tweet won't be the only factor that determines the outcome of
the lawsuit. In a claim under section 43(a) of the Lanham Act,
there's also the issue of how the drug store's followers will
interpret the tweet. Since there appears to be no question that
the tweet was literally true, the case might turn on whether
consumers were instead given the misleading impression that
Heigl had endorsed the drug store.

She's certainly not the ﬁrst celebrity to bring a false advertising
claim. For example, Sandra Bullock has been pursuing
companies for advertising a watch as the one used by the
actress in The Blind Side. That case, though, deals with venues
like e-commerce site Amazon.com as well as the purchase of
the Google AdWords term "Bullock" for promotion. This one
inhabits social media where Twitter and Facebook followers
may have diﬀerent interpretations about what they see. If the
case isn't settled, expect surveys to be done.

There is a potential drawback for Heigl in bringing the lawsuit.
Unlike Bullock, who is a clear A-lister whose recent papers in
arbitration tout how she's "America's sweetheart" with more
positive associations than even Oprah Winfrey, Heigl is a
more controversial actress thanks in part to reported bad
behavior. In recent years, she's struggled to land great acting
jobs, and as a result, there could be an issue arising in court
proceedings about the true worth of her endorsement. If the
case gets far and Duane Reade ﬁnds itself on the hook for its
social media activity, the company could attempt to probe
Heigl's professional career.

And thus, it might not only be a corporation under the
microscope, but the actress' social media imprimatur as well.
