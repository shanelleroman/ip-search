Re:  Left Shark

Dear Professor Sprigman:

I am writing  in response to your letter  dated  February  9,2015. You posed two

primary  substantive questions, to which  I respond in turn below.

First,  can you tell me why you believe the costume  of a shark  that you claim KaÍy Perry
owns is copyrightable?

Katy  Peny's team created  multiple shark  drawings  in the process  of designing

and creating  the costumes used onstage  in the televised  performance.  All of these
drawings are copyrightable, as are multiple elements of the drawings  incorporated  into
the final shark  costumes  themselves.l

Second,  what is the basis for your claim that Katy Perry, and not some other person,
owns the copyright?

Pursuant  to the terms of multiple agreements  ,Katy  Perry's company  is the owner

of all relevant  copyrights  in the works at issue.  Your speculation  based on Katy's
comments  to Elle Magazine  is inaccurate  and inapposite.

It should be noted that, in addition to copyright  causes  of action,  unfair

competition  causes  of action  would  be available  to Ms. Perry and her company  in this
situation as well. It is clear that any commercial value that your client's sculptures have
derives solely from  the public's  association of them with Ms. Perry.

tAlthough  Copyright  Office Examiners view costumes  generally as useful arlicles, the 1991 Federal  Register
Notice,  the December 2014  edition  of the Compendium,  and the applicable case law are all clear that
conceptually  separable elements  of a costume  design  can  be copyrightable.

Having said that, Katy  Perry  is not interested in a dispute with your client or anyone

else. If your client  is interested in a license to make Left Shark  products,  please call me to
discuss. If not, kindly  advise your client to stop selling such products without authorization.
