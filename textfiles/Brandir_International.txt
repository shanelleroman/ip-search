OAKES, Circuit Judge:

1
In passing the Copyright Act of 1976 Congress attempted to distinguish between protectable "works
of applied art" and "industrial designs not subject to copyright protection." See H.R.Rep. No. 1476,
94th Cong., 2d Sess. 54, reprinted in 1976 U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 5659, 5667 (hereinafter
H.R.Rep. No. 1476). The courts, however, have had difﬁculty framing tests by which the ﬁne line
establishing what is and what is not copyrightable can be drawn. Once again we are called upon to
draw such a line, this time in a case involving the "RIBBON Rack," a bicycle rack made of bent
tubing that is said to have originated from a wire sculpture. (A photograph of the rack is contained in

the appendix to this opinion.) We are also
called upon to determine whether there is any
trademark protection available to the
manufacturer of the bicycle rack, appellant
Brandir International, Inc. The Register of
Copyright, named as a third-party defendant
under the statute, 17 U.S.C. Sec. 411, but
electing not to appear, denied copyrightability.
In the subsequent suit brought in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of
New York, Charles S. Haight, Jr., Judge, the
district court granted summary judgment on
both the copyright and trademark claims to
defendant Cascade Paciﬁc Lumber Co., d/b/a
Columbia Cascade Co., manufacturer of a
similar bicycle rack. We afﬁrm as to the
copyright claim, but reverse and remand as to
the trademark claim.

Against the history of copyright protection well set out in the majority opinion in Carol Barnhart Inc. v.
Economy Cover Corp., 773 F.2d 411, 415-18 (2d Cir.1985), and in Denicola, Applied Art and
Industrial Design: A Suggested Approach to Copyright in Useful Articles, 67 Minn.L.Rev. 707, 709-
17 (1983), Congress adopted the Copyright Act of 1976. The "works of art" classiﬁcation of the
Copyright Act of 1909 was omitted and replaced by reference to "pictorial, graphic, and sculptural
works," 17 U.S.C. Sec. 102(a)(5). According to the House Report, the new category was intended to
supply "as clear a line as possible between copyrightable works of applied art and uncopyrighted
works of industrial design." H.R.Rep. No. 1476, at 55, U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1976, p.
5668. The statutory deﬁnition of "pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works" states that "the design of a
useful article, as deﬁned in this section, shall be considered a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work
only if, and only to the extent that, such design incorporates pictorial, graphic, or sculptural features
that can be identiﬁed separately from, and are capable of existing independently of, the utilitarian
aspects of the article." 17 U.S.C. Sec. 101.1 The legislative history added gloss on the criteria of
separate identity and independent existence in saying:
3
On the other hand, although the shape of an industrial product may be aesthetically satisfying and
valuable, the Committee's intention is not to offer it copyright protection under the bill. Unless the
shape of an automobile, airplane, ladies' dress, food processor, television set, or any other industrial
product contains some element that, physically or conceptually, can be identiﬁed as separable from
the utilitarian aspects of that article, the design would not be copyrighted under the bill.

H.R.Rep. No. 1476, at 55, U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1976, p. 5668.
5
As courts and commentators have come to realize, however, the line Congress attempted to draw
between copyrightable art and noncopyrightable design "was neither clear nor new." Denicola,
supra, 67 Minn.L.Rev. at 720. One aspect of the distinction that has drawn considerable attention is
the reference in the House Report to "physically or conceptually " (emphasis added) separable
elements. The District of Columbia Circuit in Esquire, Inc. v. Ringer, 591 F.2d 796, 803-04

http://openjurist.org/print/340971

834 F2d 1142 Brandir International Inc v. Cascade Paciﬁc Lumber Co L

(D.C.Cir.1978) (holding outdoor lighting ﬁxtures ineligible for copyright), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 908,
99 S.Ct. 1217, 59 L.Ed.2d 456 (1979), called this an "isolated reference" and gave it no signiﬁcance.
Professor Nimmer, however, seemed to favor the observations of Judge Harold Leventhal in his
concurrence in Esquire, who stated that "the overall legislative policy ... sustains the Copyright
Ofﬁce in its effort to distinguish between the instances where the aesthetic element is conceptually
severable and the instances where the aesthetic element is inextricably interwoven with the
utilitarian aspect of the article." 591 F.2d at 807; see 1 Nimmer on Copyright Sec. 2.08[B] at 2-93 to
2-96.2 (1986). But see Gerber, Book Review, 26 U.C.L.A.L.Rev. 925, 938-43 (1979) (criticizing
Professor Nimmer's view on conceptual separability). Looking to the section 101 deﬁnition of works
of artistic craftsmanship requiring that artistic features be "capable of existing independently of the
utilitarian aspects," Professor Nimmer queries whether that requires physical as distinguished from
conceptual separability, but answers his query by saying "[t]here is reason to conclude that it does
not." See 1 Nimmer on Copyright Sec. 2.08[B] at 2-96.1. In any event, in Kieselstein-Cord v.
Accessories by Pearl, Inc., 632 F.2d 989, 993 (2d Cir.1980), this court accepted the idea that
copyrightability can adhere in the "conceptual" separation of an artistic element. Indeed, the court
went on to ﬁnd such conceptual separation in reference to ornate belt buckles that could be and
were worn separately as jewelry. Kieselstein-Cord was followed in Norris Industries, Inc. v.
International Telephone & Telegraph Corp., 696 F.2d 918, 923-24 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S.
818, 104 S.Ct. 78, 78 L.Ed.2d 89 (1983), although there the court upheld the Register's refusal to
register automobile wire wheel covers, ﬁnding no "conceptually separable" work of art. See also
Transworld Mfg. Corp. v. Al Nyman & Sons, Inc., 95 F.R.D. 95 (D.Del.1982) (ﬁnding conceptual
separability sufﬁcient to support copyright in denying summary judgment on copyrightability of
eyeglass display cases).
6
In Carol Barnhart Inc. v. Economy Cover Corp., 773 F.2d 411 (2d Cir.1985), a divided panel of this
circuit afﬁrmed a district court grant of summary judgment of noncopyrightability of four life-sized,
anatomically correct human torso forms. Carol Barnhart distinguished Kieselstein-Cord, but it surely
did not overrule it. The distinction made was that the ornamented surfaces of the Kieselstein-Cord
belt buckles "were not in any respect required by their utilitarian functions," but the features claimed
to be aesthetic or artistic in the Carol Barnhart forms were "inextricably intertwined with the utilitarian
feature, the display of clothes." 773 F.2d at 419. But cf. Animal Fair, Inc. v. Amfesco Indus., Inc., 620
F.Supp. 175, 186-88 (D.Minn.1985) (holding bear-paw design conceptually separable from the
utilitarian features of a slipper), aff'd mem., 794 F.2d 678 (8th Cir.1986). As Judge Newman's dissent
made clear, the Carol Barnhart majority did not dispute "that 'conceptual separability' is distinct from
'physical separability' and, when present, entitles the creator of a useful article to a copyright on its
design." 773 F.2d at 420.
7
"Conceptual separability" is thus alive and well, at least in this circuit. The problem, however, is
determining exactly what it is and how it is to be applied. Judge Newman's illuminating discussion in
dissent in Carol Barnhart, see 773 F.2d at 419-24, proposed a test that aesthetic features are
conceptually separable if "the article ... stimulate[s] in the mind of the beholder a concept that is
separate from the concept evoked by its utilitarian function." Id. at 422. This approach has received
favorable endorsement by at least one commentator, W. Patry, Latman's The Copyright Law 43-45
(6th ed. 1986), who calls Judge Newman's test the "temporal displacement" test. It is to be
distinguished from other possible ways in which conceptual separability can be tested, including
whether the primary use is as a utilitarian article as opposed to an artistic work, whether the
aesthetic aspects of the work can be said to be "primary," and whether the article is marketable as
art, none of which is very satisfactory. But Judge Newman's test was rejected outright by the
majority as "a standard so ethereal as to amount to a 'nontest' that would be extremely difﬁcult, if not
impossible, to administer or apply." 773 F.2d at 419 n. 5.

Perhaps the differences between the majority and
the dissent in Carol Barnhart might have been
resolved had they had before them the Denicola
article on Applied Art and Industrial Design: A
Suggested Approach to Copyright in Useful
Articles, supra. There, Professor Denicola points
out that although the Copyright Act of 1976 was
an effort " 'to draw as clear a line as possible,' " in
truth "there is no line, but merely a spectrum of
forms and shapes responsive in varying degrees
to utilitarian concerns." 67 Minn.L.Rev. at 741.
Denicola argues that "the statutory directive
requires a distinction between works of industrial
design and works whose origins lie outside the
design process, despite the utilitarian
environment in which they appear." He views the statutory limitation of copyrightability as "an
attempt to identify elements whose form and appearance reﬂect the unconstrained perspective of
the artist," such features not being the product of industrial design. Id. at 742. "Copyrightability,
therefore, should turn on the relationship between the proffered work and the process of industrial
design." Id. at 741. He suggests that "the dominant characteristic of industrial design is the inﬂuence
of nonaesthetic, utilitarian concerns" and hence concludes that copyrightability "ultimately should
depend on the extent to which the work reﬂects artistic expression uninhibited by functional
considerations."2 Id. To state the Denicola test in the language of conceptual separability, if design
elements reﬂect a merger of aesthetic and functional considerations, the artistic aspects of a work
cannot be said to be conceptually separable from the utilitarian elements. Conversely, where design
elements can be identiﬁed as reﬂecting the designer's artistic judgment exercised independently of
functional inﬂuences, conceptual separability exists.
9
We believe that Professor Denicola's approach provides the best test for conceptual separability
and, accordingly, adopt it here for several reasons. First, the approach is consistent with the
holdings of our previous cases. In Kieselstein-Cord, for example, the artistic aspects of the belt
buckles reﬂected purely aesthetic choices, independent of the buckles' function, while in Carol
Barnhart the distinctive features of the torsos--the accurate anatomical design and the sculpted
shirts and collars--showed clearly the inﬂuence of functional concerns. Though the torsos bore
artistic features, it was evident that the designer incorporated those features to further the
usefulness of the torsos as mannequins. Second, the test's emphasis on the inﬂuence of utilitarian
concerns in the design process may help, as Denicola notes, to "alleviate the de facto discrimination
against nonrepresentational art that has regrettably accompanied much of the current analysis." Id.
at 745.3 Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we think Denicola's test will not be too difﬁcult to
administer in practice. The work itself will continue to give "mute testimony" of its origins. In addition,
the parties will be required to present evidence relating to the design process and the nature of the
work, with the trier of fact making the determination whether the aesthetic design elements are
signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by functional considerations.
10
Turning now to the facts of this case, we note ﬁrst that Brandir contends, and its chief owner David
Levine testiﬁed, that the original design of the RIBBON Rack stemmed from wire sculptures that
Levine had created, each formed from one continuous undulating piece of wire. These sculptures
were, he said, created and displayed in his home as a means of personal expression, but apparently

http://openjurist.org/print/340971

4/11

5/7/2017

834 F2d 1142 Brandir International Inc v. Cascade Paciﬁc Lumber Co L

were never sold or displayed elsewhere. He also created a wire sculpture in the shape of a bicycle
and states that he did not give any thought to the utilitarian application of any of his sculptures until
he accidentally juxtaposed the bicycle sculpture with one of the self-standing wire sculptures. It was
not until November 1978 that Levine seriously began pursuing the utilitarian application of his
sculptures, when a friend, G. Duff Bailey, a bicycle buff and author of numerous articles about urban
cycling, was at Levine's home and informed him that the sculptures would make excellent bicycle
racks, permitting bicycles to be parked under the overloops as well as on top of the underloops.
Following this meeting, Levine met several times with Bailey and others, completing the designs for
the RIBBON Rack by the use of a vacuum cleaner hose, and submitting his drawings to a fabricator
complete with dimensions. The Brandir RIBBON Rack began being nationally advertised and
promoted for sale in September 1979.
11
In November 1982 Levine discovered that another company, Cascade Paciﬁc Lumber Co., was
selling a similar product. Thereafter, beginning in December 1982, a copyright notice was placed on
all RIBBON Racks before shipment and on December 10, 1982, ﬁve copyright applications for
registration were submitted to the Copyright Ofﬁce. The Copyright Ofﬁce refused registration by
letter, stating that the RIBBON Rack did not contain any element that was "capable of independent
existence as a copyrightable pictorial, graphic or sculptural work apart from the shape of the useful
article." An appeal to the Copyright Ofﬁce was denied by letter dated March 23, 1983, refusing
registration on the above ground and alternatively on the ground that the design lacked originality,
consisting of "nothing more than a familiar public domain symbol." In February 1984, after the denial
of the second appeal of the examiner's decision, Brandir sent letters to customers enclosing
copyright notices to be placed on racks sold prior to December 1982.
12
Between September 1979 and August 1982 Brandir spent some $38,500 for advertising and
promoting the RIBBON Rack, including some 85,000 pieces of promotional literature to architects
and landscape architects. Additionally, since October 1982 Brandir has spent some $66,000,
including full-, half-, and quarter-page advertisements in architectural magazines such as
Landscape Architecture, Progressive Architecture, and Architectural Record, indeed winning an
advertising award from Progressive Architecture in January 1983. The RIBBON Rack has been
featured in Popular Science, Art and Architecture, and Design 384 magazines, and it won an
Industrial Designers Society of America design award in the spring of 1980. In the spring of 1984 the
RIBBON Rack was selected from 200 designs to be included among 77 of the designs exhibited at
the Katonah Gallery in an exhibition entitled "The Product of Design: An Exploration of the Industrial
Design Process," an exhibition that was written up in the New York Times.
13
Sales of the RIBBON Rack from September 1979 through January 1985 were in excess of
$1,367,000. Prior to the time Cascade Paciﬁc began offering for sale its bicycle rack in August 1982,
Brandir's sales were $436,000. The price of the RIBBON Rack ranges from $395 up to $2,025 for a
stainless steel model and generally depends on the size of the rack, one of the most popular being
the RB-7, selling for $485.
14
Applying Professor Denicola's test to the RIBBON Rack, we ﬁnd that the rack is not copyrightable. It
seems clear that the form of the rack is inﬂuenced in signiﬁcant measure by utilitarian concerns and
thus any aesthetic elements cannot be said to be conceptually separable from the utilitarian
elements. This is true even though the sculptures which inspired the RIBBON Rack may well have
been--the issue of originality aside--copyrightable.

15
Brandir argues correctly that a copyrighted work of art does not lose its protected status merely
because it subsequently is put to a functional use. The Supreme Court so held in Mazer v. Stein,
347 U.S. 201, 74 S.Ct. 460, 98 L.Ed. 630 (1954), and Congress speciﬁcally intended to accept and
codify Mazer in section 101 of the Copyright Act of 1976. See H.R.Rep. No. 1476 at 54-55. The
district court thus erred in ruling that, whatever the RIBBON Rack's origins, Brandir's
commercialization of the rack disposed of the issue of its copyrightability.
16
Had Brandir merely adopted one of the existing sculptures as a bicycle rack, neither the application
to a utilitarian end nor commercialization of that use would have caused the object to forfeit its
copyrighted status. Comparison of the RIBBON Rack with the earlier sculptures, however, reveals
that while the rack may have been derived in part from one of more "works of art," it is in its ﬁnal
form essentially a product of industrial design. In creating the RIBBON Rack, the designer has
clearly adapted the original aesthetic elements to accommodate and further a utilitarian purpose.
These altered design features of the RIBBON Rack, including the spacesaving, open design
achieved by widening the upper loops to permit parking under as well as over the rack's curves, the
straightened vertical elements that allow in- and above-ground installation of the rack, the ability to
ﬁt all types of bicycles and mopeds, and the heavy-gauged tubular construction of rustproof
galvanized steel, are all features that combine to make for a safe, secure, and maintenance-free
system of parking bicycles and mopeds. Its undulating shape is said in Progressive Architecture,
January 1982, to permit double the storage of conventional bicycle racks. Moreover, the rack is
manufactured from 2 3/8-inch standard steam pipe that is bent into form, the six-inch radius of the
bends evidently resulting from bending the pipe according to a standard formula that yields bends
having a radius equal to three times the nominal internal diameter of the pipe.
17
Brandir argues that its RIBBON Rack can and should be characterized as a sculptural work of art
within the minimalist art movement. Minimalist sculpture's most outstanding feature is said to be its
clarity and simplicity, in that it often takes the form of geometric shapes, lines, and forms that are
pure and free of ornamentation and void of association. As Brandir's expert put it, "The meaning is
to be found in, within, around and outside the work of art, allowing the artistic sensation to be
experienced as well as intellectualized." People who use Foley Square in New York City see in the
form of minimalist art the "Tilted Arc," which is on the plaza at 26 Federal Plaza. Numerous
museums have had exhibitions of such art, and the school of minimalist art has many admirers.
18
It is unnecessary to determine whether to the art world the RIBBON Rack properly would be
considered an example of minimalist sculpture. The result under the copyright statute is not
changed. Using the test we have adopted, it is not enough that, to paraphrase Judge Newman, the
rack may stimulate in the mind of the reasonable observer a concept separate from the bicycle rack
concept. While the RIBBON Rack may be worthy of admiration for its aesthetic qualities alone, it
remains nonetheless the product of industrial design. Form and function are inextricably intertwined
in the rack, its ultimate design being as much the result of utilitarian pressures as aesthetic choices.
Indeed, the visually pleasing proportions and symmetricality of the rack represent design changes
made in response to functional concerns. Judging from the awards the rack has received, it would
seem in fact that Brandir has achieved with the RIBBON Rack the highest goal of modern industrial
design, that is, the harmonious fusion of function and aesthetics. Thus there remains no artistic
element of the RIBBON Rack that can be identiﬁed as separate and "capable of existing
independently, of, the utilitarian aspects of the article." Accordingly, we must afﬁrm on the copyright
claim.

19
As to whether the conﬁguration of Brandir's bicycle rack can be protected under either section 43(a)
of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1125(a), or New York State unfair competition law, we are
reminded that the design of a product itself may function as its packaging or protectable trade dress.
See LeSportsac, Inc. v. K mart Corp., 754 F.2d 71, 75 (2d Cir.1985). The district court dismissed
Brandir's claims, saying that its analysis of the copyright issue was sufﬁcient to dispose of the
Lanham Act and common law claims. The court stated "the design feature of the Ribbon Racks is
clearly dictated by the function to be performed, namely, holding up bicycles. If the steam pipes
were not bent into the design, but instead remained ﬂat, the bicycles would not stand up, they would
fall down." But as Judge Newman noted in his dissent in Carol Barnhart, 773 F.2d at 420 n. 1, the
principle of conceptual separability of functional design elements in copyright law is different from
the somewhat similar principle of functionality as developed in trademark law. For trademark
purposes, he pointed out, a design feature "has been said to be functional if it is 'essential to the use
or purpose of the article' or 'affects the cost or quality of the article.' " Id. (quoting Inwood
Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc., 456 U.S. 844, 850 n. 10, 102 S.Ct. 2182, 2187 n. 10, 72
L.Ed.2d 606 (1982)); see LeSportsac, Inc. v. K mart Corp., 754 F.2d at 75-76 (trade dress of a
product is eligible for protection if it has acquired a secondary meaning and is nonfunctional).4
20
Here, the district court limited its inquiry to determining whether portions of the RIBBON Rack
performed the function of a bicycle rack. But the fact that a design feature performs a function does
not make it essential to the performance of that function; it is instead the absence of alternative
constructions performing the same function that renders the feature functional. Thus, the true test of
functionality is not whether the feature in question performs a function, but whether the feature "is
dictated by the functions to be performed," Warner Bros. Inc. v. Gay Toys, Inc., 724 F.2d 327, 331
(2d Cir.1983) (quoted in LeSportsac, Inc. v. K mart Corp., 754 F.2d at 76), as evidenced by available
alternative constructions. See Metro Kane Imports, Ltd. v. Rowoco, Inc., 618 F.Supp. 273, 275-76
(S.D.N.Y.1985), aff'd mem., 800 F.2d 1128 (2d Cir.1986) (ﬁnding high-tech design of orange juice
squeezer not dictated by function to be performed as there was no evidence that design permitted
juicer to be manufactured at lower price or with altered performance). There are numerous
alternative bicycle rack constructions. The nature, price, and utility of these constructions are
material issues of fact not suitable for determination by summary judgment.5 For example, while it is
true that the materials used by Brandir are standard-size pipes, we have no way of knowing whether
the particular size and weight of the pipes used is the best, the most economical, or the only
available size and weight pipe in the marketplace. We would rather think the opposite might be the
case. So, too, with the dimension of the bends being dictated by a standard formula corresponding
to the pipe size; it could be that there are many standard radii and that the particular radius of
Brandir's RIBBON Rack actually required new tooling. This issue of functionality on remand should
be viewed in terms of bicycle racks generally and not one-piece undulating bicycle racks speciﬁcally.
See id. at 330-32; see also In re DC Comics, Inc., 689 F.2d 1042, 1045 (C.C.P.A.1982) (dolls
generally and not Superman dolls are the class by which functionality is determined). We reverse
and remand as to the trademark and unfair competition claims.
21
Judgment afﬁrmed as to the copyright claim; reversed and remanded as to the trademark and unfair
competition claims.

APPENDIX
23
NOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLEWINTER, Circuit
Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:
24
Although I concur in the reversal of the district court's grant of summary judgment on the trademark
and unfair competition claims, I respectfully dissent from the majority's discussion and disposition of
the copyright claim.
25
My colleagues, applying an adaptation of Professor Denicola's test, hold that the aesthetic elements
of the design of a useful article are not conceptually separable from its utilitarian aspects if "[f]orm
and function are inextricably intertwined" in the article, and "its ultimate design [is] as much the
result of utilitarian pressures as aesthetic choices." Applying that test to the instant matter, they
observe that the dispositive fact is that "in creating the Ribbon Rack, [Levine] has clearly adapted
the original aesthetic elements to accommodate and further a utilitarian purpose." (emphasis
added). The grounds of my disagreement are that: (1) my colleagues' adaptation of Professor
Denicola's test diminishes the statutory concept of "conceptual separability" to the vanishing point;
and (2) their focus on the process or sequence followed by the particular designer makes copyright
protection depend upon largely fortuitous circumstances concerning the creation of the design in
issue.
26
With regard to "conceptual separability," my colleagues deserve considerable credit for their efforts
to reconcile Carol Barnhart Inc. v. Economy Cover Corp., 773 F.2d 411 (2d Cir.1985) with
Kieselstein-Cord v. Accessories by Pearl, Inc., 632 F.2d 989 (2d Cir.1980). In my view, these cases
are not reconcilable. Carol Barnhart paid only lip service to the fact that the "conceptual separability"
of an article's aesthetic utilitarian aspects may render the design of a "useful article" a copyrightable
"sculptural work." 17 U.S.C. Sec. 101 (1982). Actually, the Carol Barnhart majority applied a test of
physical separability. They thus stated:
27
What distinguishes [the Kieselstein Cord ] buckles from the Barnhart forms is that the ornamented
surfaces of the buckles were not in any respect required by their utilitarian functions; the artistic and
aesthetic features could thus be conceived of as having been added to, or superimposed upon, an
otherwise utilitarian article. The unique artistic design was wholly unnecessary to performance of the
utilitarian function. In the case of the Barnhart forms, on the other hand, the features claimed to be
aesthetic or artistic, e.g., the life-size conﬁguration of the breasts and the width of the shoulders are
inextricably intertwined with the utilitarian feature, the display of clothes.
28
773 F.2d at 419 (emphasis added). In contrast, Kieselstein-Cord focused on the fact that the belt
buckles at issue could be perceived as objects other than belt buckles:
29
We see in appellant's belt buckles conceptually separable sculptural elements, as apparently have
the buckles' wearers who have used them as ornamentation for parts of the body other than the

My colleagues' adaptation of the Denicola test tracks the Carol Barnhart approach, whereas I would
adopt that taken in Kieselstein-Cord, which allows for the copyrightability of the aesthetic elements
of useful articles even if those elements simultaneously perform utilitarian functions.1 The latter
approach received its fullest elaboration in Judge Newman's dissent in Carol Barnhart, where he
explained that "[f]or the [artistic] design features to be 'conceptually separate' from the utilitarian
aspects of the useful article that embodies the design, the article must stimulate in the mind of the
beholder a concept that is separate from the concept evoked by its utilitarian function." 773 F.2d at
422 (Newman, J., dissenting).
32
In other words, the relevant question is whether the design of a useful article, however intertwined
with the article's utilitarian aspects, causes an ordinary reasonable observer to perceive an aesthetic
concept not related to the article's use. The answer to this question is clear in the instant case
because any reasonable observer would easily view the Ribbon Rack as an ornamental sculpture.2
Indeed, there is evidence of actual confusion over whether it is strictly ornamental in the refusal of a
building manager to accept delivery until assured by the buyer that the Ribbon Rack was in fact a
bicycle rack. Moreover, Brandir has received a request to use the Ribbon Rack as environmental
sculpture, and has offered testimony of art experts who claim that the Ribbon Rack may be valued
solely for its artistic features. As one of those experts observed: "If one were to place a Ribbon Rack
on an island without access, or in a park and surround the work with a barrier, ... its status as a work
of art would be beyond dispute."3
33
My colleagues also allow too much to turn upon the process or sequence of design followed by the
designer of the Ribbon Rack. They thus suggest that copyright protection would have been
accorded "had Brandir merely adopted ... as a bicycle rack" an enlarged version of one of David
Levine's original sculptures rather than one that had wider upper loops and straightened vertical
elements. I cannot agree that copyright protection for the Ribbon Rack turns on whether Levine
serendipitously chose the ﬁnal design of the Ribbon Rack during his initial sculptural musings or
whether the original design had to be slightly modiﬁed to accommodate bicycles. Copyright
protection, which is intended to generate incentives for designers by according property rights in
their creations, should not turn on purely fortuitous events. For that reason, the Copyright Act
expressly states that the legal test is how the ﬁnal article is perceived, not how it was developed
through various stages. It thus states in pertinent part:
34
the design of a useful article ... shall be considered a ... sculptural work only if, and only to the extent
that, such design incorporates ... sculptural features that can be identiﬁed separately from, and are
capable of existing independently of, the utilitarian aspects of the article.

I therefore dissent from the decision so far as it relates to copyrightability but concur in its discussion
and holding as to the trademark and unfair competition claims.

Of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, sitting by designation

The statute also deﬁnes "useful article" as one "having an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not
merely to portray the appearance of the article or to convey information. An article that is normally a
part of a useful article is considered a 'useful article.' " 17 U.S.C. Sec. 101
2
Professor Denicola rejects the exclusion of all works created with some utilitarian application in view,
for that would not only overturn Mazer v. Stein, 347 U.S. 201, 74 S.Ct. 460, 98 L.Ed. 630 (1954), on
which much of the legislation is based, but also "a host of other eminently sensible decisions, in
favor of an intractable factual inquiry of questionable relevance." 67 Minn.L.Rev. at 741. He adds
that "[a]ny such categorical approach would also undermine the legislative determination to
preserve an artist's ability to exploit utilitarian markets." Id. (citing 17 U.S.C. Sec. 113(a) (1976))
3
We are reminded not only by Judge Gesell in the district court in Esquire, 414 F.Supp. 939, 941
(D.D.C.1976), but by Holmes in Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing Co., 188 U.S. 239, 251-52, 23
S.Ct. 298, 300-01, 47 L.Ed. 460 (1903), by Mazer v. Stein, 347 U.S. at 214, 74 S.Ct. at 468, and by
numerous other opinions, that we judges should not let our own view of styles of art interfere with
the decisionmaking process in this area. Denicola suggests that the shape of a Mickey Mouse
telephone is copyrightable because its form is independent of function, and "[a] telephone shape
owing more to Arp, Brancusi, or Moore than Disney may be equally divorced from utilitarian
inﬂuence." 67 Minn.L.Rev. at 746. This is true, of course, of the artist Christo's "Running Fence,"
approved (following Professor Nimmer) as an example of conceptual separability in Keiselstein-
Cord, 632 F.2d at 993
4
Because the district court viewed the rack as entirely functional, it therefore did not reach the next
step of determining whether Brandir's RIBBON Rack had acquired secondary meaning by the time
Cascade started to manufacture its bicycle rack
5
Indeed, in addition to the numerous bicycle racks on the market, one may observe trees, awning
supports, parking meters, signs, ﬁre plugs, and many other objects used as bicycle racks
1
Indeed, Kieselstein-Cord approved Professor Nimmer's example of Christo's "Running Fence" as an
object whose sculptural features were conceptually, but not physically, separable from its utilitarian
aspects. 632 F.2d at 993; see 1 Nimmer on Copyright Sec. 2.08[B] at 2-96.1 & n. 112.2 (1987). The
fact that the Running Fence's aesthetic features were "inextricably intertwined" with its functional
aspects, however, creates doubt as to whether it is a copyrightable "sculptural work" under Carol
Barnhart or the instant decision

The reasonable observer may be forgiven, however, if he or she does not recognize the Ribbon
Rack as an example of minimalist art
3
The Copyright Ofﬁce held that the Ribbon Rack was not copyrightable because it lacked originality.
There may be some merit in that view in light of the Ribbon Rack's use of standard radii. This issue,
however, was not raised in defendant's motion for summary judgment, was not addressed by the
district court, and is not implicated here
