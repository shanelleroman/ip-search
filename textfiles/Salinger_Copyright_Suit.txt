Ruling for Salinger, Judge Bans ‘Rye’ Sequel

Updated, 6:17 p.m. | In a victory for the reclusive writer J. D. Salinger, a federal

judge on Wednesday indefinitely banned publication in the United States of a new
book by a Swedish author that contains a 76-year-old version of Holden Caulfield,
the protagonist of “The Catcher in the Rye.”

The judge, Deborah A. Batts, of United States District Court in Manhattan, had
granted a 10-day temporary restraining order last month against the author, Fredrik
Colting, who wrote the new novel under the pen name J. D. California.

In a 37-page ruling, Judge Batts issued a preliminary injunction — indefinitely

banning the publication, advertising or distribution of the book in this country —
after considering the merits of the case. The book has been published in Britain.

“I am pretty blown away by the judge’s decision,” Mr. Colting said in an e-mail

message after the ruling. “Call me an ignorant Swede, but the last thing I thought
possible in the U.S. was that you banned books.” Mr. Colting and his lawyer, Edward
H. Rosenthal, said they would appeal. The decision means that “members of the
public are deprived of the chance to read the book and decide for themselves
whether it adds to their understanding of Salinger and his work,” Mr. Rosenthal
said.

Marcia B. Paul, a lawyer for Mr. Salinger, declined to comment on the decision.

In a copyright infringement lawsuit filed June 1, lawyers for Mr. Salinger

contended that the new work was derivative of “Catcher” and Holden Caulfield, and

infringed on Mr. Salinger’s copyright.

The work by Mr. Colting, 33, centers on a 76-year-old “Mr. C,” the creation of a
writer named Mr. Salinger. Although the name Holden Caulfield does not appear in
the book, Mr. C is clearly Holden, one of the best-known adolescent figures in
American fiction, aged 60 years.

(The similarities between the characters were not much in dispute. As Judge
Batts wrote in her ruling, “Both narratives are told from the first-person point of
view of a sarcastic, often uncouth protagonist who relies heavily on slang,
euphemisms and colloquialisms, makes constant digression and asides, refers to
readers in the second person, constantly assures the reader that he is being honest
and that he is giving them the truth.”)

Mr. Colting’s lawyers argued, among other things, that the new novel, titled “60

Years Later: Coming Through the Rye,” did not violate copyright laws because it
amounted to a critical parody that had the effect of transforming the original work.

Judge Batts rejected that argument, writing:

To the extent Defendants contend that 60 Years and the character of

Mr. C direct parodic comment or criticism at Catcher or Holden Caulfield, as
opposed to Salinger himself, the Court finds such contentions to be post-hoc
rationalizations employed through vague generalizations about the alleged
naivety of the original, rather than reasonably perceivable parody.

The judge’s ruling weighed literary arguments made by both sides in the

dispute. “To the extent Colting claims to augment the purported portrait of Caulfield
as a ‘free-thinking, authentic and untainted youth,’ and ‘impeccable judge of the
people around him’ displayed in Catcher by ‘show[ing] the effects of Holden’s
uncompromising world view,'” Judge Batts wrote, citing a memo submitted by Mr.
Colting, “those effects were already thoroughly depicted and apparent in Salinger’s
own narrative about Caulfield.”

Judge Batts added:

In fact, it can be argued that the contrast between Holden’s authentic

but critical and rebellious nature and his tendency toward depressive
alienation is one of the key themes of Catcher. That many readers and critics
have apparently idolized Caulfield for the former, despite — or perhaps
because of — the latter, does not change the fact that those elements were
already apparent in Catcher.

It is hardly parodic to repeat that same exercise in contrast, just because

society and the characters have aged.

While the case could still go to trial, Judge Batts’s ruling means that Mr.

Colting’s book cannot be published in the United States pending the resolution of
the litigation, which could drag on for months or years.

Mr. Salinger, who has not published any new work since 1965, has sued several
times to protect his works, including successful efforts to stop publication of some of
his personal letters in a biography and to halt a staging of “Catcher” by a college
theater company in San Francisco. He has also turned down requests, from Steven
Spielberg, among others, for movie adaptations of “Catcher.”
