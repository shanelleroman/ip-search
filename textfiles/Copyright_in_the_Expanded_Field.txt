COPYRIGHT  IN THE EXPANDED  FIELD'

Xiyin  Tang*

Intellectual property ("IP")  law  and the  art forms  it is  meant  to
protect are expanding. In  our information age, artists hoping to  assert
their rights frequently assert a combination of trademark, copyright, and
right of publicity  or moral  rights claims  in  order to  maximize  their
chances of success. This Article looks beyond IP law to some of its more
unlikely  complements-tort and property law-as  a  viable  means  of
redress for  artists who  may  be  ineligible for  copyright protection.
Specifically, recent cases involving a specific form of hybrid art-land
art, or  "site specific art"-have determinedly stripped artists of either
their moral rights  or copyright claims.  Thus,  I  suggest looking  to  the
laws  of trespass and nuisance as new  ways  of thinking about the same
problem: How do  we  balance public rights in our shared artworks with
private  rights  of  control?  Surprisingly,  this  Article  suggests  that
applying nuisance law's balancing test  has much  in common  with  the
four-factor balancing test of copyright's fair use doctrine. On a greater
level, this Article hopes to encourage the ongoing trend of creative ways
of thinking about and asserting artistic rights when traditional copyright
claims may not be feasible or successful.

1.  This  Article takes  its name from  the  1978 essay  by Rosalind Krauss  titled  Sculpture in the
Expanded Field, which  perfectly  documents  the phenomenon  of post-1960s  artists working  in  an
expanded  medium  that  encompasses  elements  of  architecture,  landscape,  nature,  and  traditional
sculpture. Rosalind  Krauss, Sculpture in the Expanded Field, OCTOBER,  Spring  1979,  at 31.

It is  about  fifteen  hundred  feet in  length and  fifteen  feet wide,  built
from  6650  tons  of basalt  rocks  and  earth.2  It  sits  just  south  of Rozel
Point,  in  Utah's  Salt  Lake,  next to  swirls  of black  oil  from  abandoned
rigs. Thousands  of people  make  the  pilgrimage  each  year  to  see  it,  and
they  are  photographed  from  above,  standing  like  tiny  ants  atop  the  salt,
as if minute  stars dotting a constellation. For the rest of us, we see it only
through photographs,  almost always aerial  views, in  which the swirl  cuts
across  its  site  like  "a  strange  footprint  on  the  shores  of the  unknown."3
As  it turns  out,  "even  the  artist  is  startled to  discover  that this  'footprint
is our own.' 4

Is  it architecture?  Is  it  a larger-than-life  sculpture?  Is  it nature? Is  it

a man-made  imitation of the former?  Is it a site? Is it life itself?.

It  is,  of course,  Robert  Smithson's  Spiral Jetty  ("Spiral Jetty"  or
"Jetty"), an  iconic  earthwork  or  piece  of  "land  art"  that  has,  since  its
creation,  been  the  stuff of  art  historical  myth  and  fable-not  least  of
which  was  its  submersion  under  water  at  the  same  time  that  Smithson
died  in  a  fatal  plane  crash,  creating  a  sort  of  double  negative  or

disappearance.5  While the Jetty is perhaps the  most famous  earthwork,  it
is not alone. Walter de  Maria's Lightning Field in New Mexico,  Michael
Heizer's  Effigy  Tumuli  in  Illinois,  and James  Turrell's  Roden  Crater in
Arizona  are  just  a  few  of the  many  examples  of artists  working  in
expanded  mediums 
that  implicate  site,  architecture,  sculpture,  and
nature-as-material.

Copyright  law,  on  the  other  hand,  only  extends  protection  to  eight
categories  of  works:  literary  works,  musical  works,  dramatic  works,
choreographic  works, 
pictorial/graphic/sculptural  works,  motion
pictures,  sound  recordings,  and  architectural  works.6  Numerous  legal
scholars  have  already  noted  that  evolving  forms  of  art-not  just
appropriation  art  (for  which  fair  use  remains  a  field  ripe  with
possibilities  and  problems),7  but  conceptual  art,  performance  art,  and
temporal "happenings,"  which  are notable for their ephemerality8 -seem
incompatible  and  fundamentally  unprotectable  under  the  very  laws
intended  for their  protection.  Land  art,  specifically,  does  not  neatly  fit
into any of the above-named  categories.

interlinked.1 ° But  as evolving  forms  of art begin  to  look less comfortably
like  traditional  artworks,  perhaps  it  would  do  us  well  to  expand  our
thinking  beyond  IP  law,  as  well. This  is  where  focusing  on the  specific

is  not  defined  in  relation  to  a  given  medium-

Art  historian Rosalind  Krauss has  traced the  art historical  suspicion
for  the  new  hybridity  of sculpture  to  "the  modernist  demand  for  the
purity  and  separateness  of the  various  mediums.""1  While  land  art  may
seem  "rigorously  logical"  from "within  the situation  of postmodernism,"
where  "practice 
sculpture-but  rather  in  relation  to  the  logical  operations  on  a  set  of
cultural  terms,  for  which  any  medium-photography,  books,  lines  on
walls,  mirrors,  or  sculpture 
itself-might  be  used,"' 2  contemporary
copyright  law  still  remains  very  much  focused  and,  might  I  add,
dependent  on  a  very  specific  notion  of  modernist  medium  purity,
autonomy,  and  specificity.  Indeed,  throughout  the  history  of copyright
law,  judges  have  engaged  in  exactly  the  kind  of modernist  definitional
line-drawing  that  attempts  to  reduce,  via  a  single  set  of finite,  discrete
criteria,  a  specific  medium  to  its  "inherent"  end  logic.' 3  Thus,  if legal
scholarship  from  the  past  decade  has  insisted on  copyright's  outdated
reliance  on  the  notion  of the  nineteenth  century  romantic  author, 14  I
argue  instead  that  it  is  precisely  the  twentieth century  avant-garde  that
copyright  law  owes  its  debt  to  in  its  insistence  on  the  purity  of the
medium  itself.

Further,  land  art  proves  to  be  a  timely  and  especially  interesting
case  study for  our  purposes,  as two  recent  circuit  court  decisions  have
essentially  deemed  this  hybrid  art  form  unprotectable--either  under

Rights  Act  of  1990  ("VARA"  or  "Act"). 15 I  focus  Part II  of this  Article
on  these  two  decisions  and  their  implications  for  earthworks. 16 Part  III
then links  these  legal  opinions  to a  surprising  predecessor:  the twentieth
century  avant-garde  insistence  on  medium  purity,  not  the  nineteenth
century  romantic  author  construct  that most  legal  scholars  have  focused
on  in  their  analysis  of copyright  doctrine's  limitations.' 7 Applying  this
reasoning,  I  come,  in Part IV, to  the seemingly disappointing  conclusion
that  this  new  form  of hybrid  art  is,  logically,  uncopyrightable. 8  Yet,  I
propose  two  new forms  of protection under real  property  and tort  law-
specifically,  the  claims  of trespass  and  nuisance-which  seem  to  most
aptly  reflect  land  art's  site-specific  aspirations.' 9  Above  all,  I  suggest
that  we  may  think  of legal  protection  for  artworks  not  as  an  either-or
(either  it  is  uncopyrightable  and hence  unprotectable  or  vice  versa),  but
as  existing  in  an  expanded  field  that  encompasses  other  viable  options
for redress, like real property or tort law.20

II.  THE LEGAL DILEMMA  OF NON-TRADITIONAL  ART  FORMS

A.  Copyright Basics

There  are  a  few  funny  requirements  of  copyright  law  that  will
form the  chief  concerns  of this  Article  and  its  case  law analysis.  I  will
review  them  each  briefly  in  this  Subpart,  but  they  can  be  summed  up
into  three  major  themes:  fixation,  the  idea-expression  dichotomy,  and
medium categorization.

The  first two  are  relatively  straightforward.  One  of the  most  basic
requirements  for  copyright  protection  is  that  an  "original  work[]  of
authorship  [be]  fixed  in  any  tangible  medium.",21  The  fixation-in-a-
tangible-medium  requirement  interacts  with,  and  informs,  the  other
major requirement  of copyright  law:  that  only  expression,  not ideas,  can
be  copyrighted.22  After  all,  if  an  idea  is  abstract  then  expression  is
concrete,  manifesting  itself in  something  physical  and  tangible.  Indeed,

15.  The two  cases  are Kelley  v.  Chi. Park Dist.,  635  F.3d  290,  298,  300 (7th  Cir. 2011)  and

Phillips v. Pembroke Real Estate, Inc.,  459 F.3d  128,  140,  143  (1st Cir. 2006).

idea,  procedure,  process,  system...  concept,  principle,  or  discovery,  regardless  of  the  form  in
which it is described, explained,  illustrated,  or embodied  in such work.").

HOFSTRA LAW REVIEW

[Vol. 42:945

the two  requirements  are  frequently  discussed  together  by  courts  when
examining  whether  a work  satisfies  these  most basic  of requirements.23
But,  of  course,  the  two  present  their  own,  unique  problems.  Even
presuming 
in  a  concrete  way
(in  a  performance,  for  example),  if  there  is  no  tangible  record  of  it
(in  a 
that  expression  would  not  be
copyrightable,  either.24

that  an  "idea"  was  "expressed" 

recording, 

for  example), 

The  third major  concern  of this  Article  is  a  surprising  one,  for  the
very word "medium"  seems to be more  of an art historical  preoccupation
than  a  legal  one.  For  modernism,  which  reached  its  apex  in  the  1960s
with  the  stronghold  of art critics  such  as  Clement  Greenberg,  medium
specificity  was  an  imperative  that drove  critics  to  attempt  to  distill just
what made  a painting a painting, a  sculpture  a sculpture,  a photograph  a
photograph,  and  art  art.  Greenberg,  the  king  of modernist  art  critics,
penned  his  most  famous  work  on  medium  specificity,  Modernist
Painting,  in  which  he  defines  what  painting  is-a  purely  visual
experience  that  is  first  and  foremost flat, rendered  so  by the  flatness  of
its pictorial  surface.25

Yet  copyright,  too,  relies  on  assumptions  about  the 

inherent
characteristics  of  a  specific  medium,  even  if  such  assumptions  are
implicit rather than  explicit.  For example,  in  deciding that  an  object  that
has utilitarian  concerns  simply  cannot  qualify  for copyright  protection,26
courts  are  doing more than adhering  to the letter  of the  law,  which states
that useful  articles belong  to  the realm  of patents 27-they  are  saying  that
artworks, 
like  Greenberg's  flat  picture  plane,  should  be  inherently
useless,  and the  more useless  they are,  the more likely  it will  be that they
are  eligible for copyright.  Some  might object, then again,  that this leaves
us  merely  with  a  distinction  between  copyrightable  artworks  and
noncopyrightable  non-art,  without  necessarily  defining  mediums  within
the copyright statute.

23.  See  Dollcraft  Indus.,  Ltd.  v.  Well-Made  Toy  Mfg.  Co.,  479  F.  Supp.  1105,  1113
(E.D.N.Y.  1978)  ("[C]opyright  law protects  an individual's  concrete  expression of his  own  idea.").
24.  See,  e.g.,  Hoopla  Sports  & Entm't, Inc.  v.  Nike,  Inc.,  947  F.  Supp.  347,  354  (N.D.  Ill.
1996)  (noting  that  even  if a  basketball  game  is  copyrightable,  the  fact  that  it  was  not  recorded
renders it  ineligible  for copyright).

COPYRIGHT IN THE EXPANDED FIELD

Yet  land art,  in  traversing the boundaries  of sculpture,  architecture,
land,  or  site,  brashly  confronts  judges  with  the  problem  of  medium
definition  within  the  copyright  statute.  Even  more  importantly,  consider
VARA,  which  gives the  author  of a painting,  drawing,  print,  sculpture,
or  photograph  that  exist  in  two  hundred  copies  or  less  the  right  to
prevent  the  destruction,  distortion,  mutilation,  or other modification of a
work  that  would  be  prejudicial  to  the  author's  reputation.28  A  work
labeled  "architecture"  instead  of "sculpture,"  then, would  not be eligible
for  VARA protection.  Judges could  either decide,  for example,  that land
art  is more  like  "architecture"  and hence  not subject to  VARA,  or that it
is not art at all.

As we will  see  below, the  few  courts that have  confronted the  issue
issue  of  medium
of  land  art  have  also  implicitly  confronted  the 
specificity-what  a medium is,  what  it should  be, what  it contains, what
it does.  But their failure to acknowledge  the very assumptions  they made
about  mediums  has  led  to much  confusion,  and, as  others  have  pointed
out,  poor case  law. 29  For,  as it  turns  out, the  two  courts  that  have  most
notoriously  opined  on  land  art  have  done  so  from  a  highly  modernist-
inflected  view  of sculpture:  that  sculptural  works  should  be  man-made,
these  self-contained
static  and  unchanging,  and,  above  all, 
the  white  walls

Earthworks  do not fit comfortably  into the  self-contained,  walled-in
ethos of the  museum and its pedestals. Minimalism,  with its  emphasis  on
atmosphere  and environment,  was the natural  predecessor  of these large-
scale,  site-specific  works  that  cannot  be  easily  divorced  from  their
surroundings.  In  a  problematic  case  for  this  new  hybrid  sculpture,  the
court  created  a judicially-imposed  VARA  carve-out  for site-specific  art,
holding that VARA's "integrity"  right  (the right to prevent modifications
and mutilations  of the  artwork) did not apply to  removals of site-specific
art  from  its,  well,  site.3 '  In  Phillips v. Pembroke Real Estate, Inc.,32  the

the  stones 

designed  a  series  of stoneworks  for  Boston's  Eastport  Park.33  These
sculptures,  which  depicted  Zodiac  signs  and marine  animals,  contained
granite  stones  that  mirrored 
located  along  the  Boston
Harbor.34  In  2003,  the  defendant,  Pembroke  Real  Estate,  moved  to
relocate  some  of Phillips's sculptures  off of the  park  grounds.35  Phillips
sued  under VARA claiming  the  integrity right,  arguing  that the  Eastport
Park  itself,  including  the  granite  paths  and  the  sea  walls  of Boston
Harbor  near  which  it  is  located,  is  integral  to  his  work.36  The  First
Circuit  disagreed-to  say  the  least.  Rather  than  simply  holding  that the
sculpture  could  be  dissembled  and  removed  without  violating  VARA
rights  so  long as  the  integrity of the  sculptures themselves  were  kept
intact, the court  went  further  in holding  that no  work of site-specific  art
is protected  under VARA.37

Their  reasoning  relied  on  the  "public  presentation"  exception  of
VARA,  which  states  that  "[t]he  modification  of  a  work  of visual  art
which  is  the  result  of  conservation,  or  of  the  public  presentation,
including  lighting  and  placement,  of  the  work  is  not  a  destruction,
distortion,  mutilation,  or  other  modification. 3 8  The  court  below  had
interpreted  this to  mean  that VARA  allows for the  removal  of the work
from  its  site,  but  requires  that  the work  itself be  kept  intact.39 There  is
evidence  that  this  was  in  line  with  Congress's  wishes  when  drafting
VARA,  as  they  noted  that  "the  removal  of  a  work  from  a  specific
location  comes  within  the  [presentation]  exclusion  because  the  location
is a matter  of presentation. ' 4°

But  the  First  Circuit  went  further.  It  first  acknowledged  Phillips's
argument  that  site  itself  is  integral  to  site-specific  art,  helped  along  by
testimony from a few of those  within  the art historical community. 41  One
testimony,  for  example,  opined  to  the  court  that  "[m]uch  of modem
sculpture  does not exist separate from its context, but rather integrates  its
context  with  the  work  to  form,  ideally,  a  seamless  whole. 42  The  First
Circuit, applying  this logic,  deemed  it an illogical  reading  of VARA  that
the  Act  would  both  protect  site-specific  art  against  modification  or

mutilation,  yet  allow  for  precisely  its  modification  or  mutilation  by
divorcing  it from its site, which operates  as part of the work.43

Needless  to  say,  the  reasoning  is  slightly  attenuated,  though  best
elucidated  in  this  one  either-or:  "Either  VARA  recognizes  site-specific
art  and  protects it,  or it  does not recognize  site-specific  art  at all. '"44  The
court's  ultimate  decision  reflects  a  deep  antagonism  to  land  art's
uncomfortable  position between  that of traditional  art  objects,  governed
by the  law  of chattels (movable  property),  and land, governed by the law
of real property.

American  law  is  already  deeply  protective  of the  rights  that  attach
to any piece of property,  including  chattel,  and VARA  has been  roundly
criticized  for  its  limitations  on  what  an  owner  may  do  with  his  own
painting-including  destroy  it,  alter  it,  and  paint  over  it.45  The  First
Circuit's  refusal  to  grant  VARA  protection  to  land  art,  then,  shows
judges'  reluctance  to  extend  VARA  any  farther  than  the  traditional
categories  of "painting,  prints,  sculpture,  and  drawing"  that  it  protects.
Further,  both  the  Phillips and  Kelley  v.  Chicago Park District46  courts,
discussed  below,  have  interpreted  these  categories  as  autonomous,
separate  mediums,  rather  than  loose  categories  within  which  hybrids
may be  constructed. 47 Real  property-land--on  the  other hand, presents
graver  concerns,  as  the  First  Circuit  suggests  that  "owners  of nearby
property  who  had  nothing  to  do  with  the  purchase  or  installation  of
Phillips's works would  be subject  to claims  that what  they do  with  their
property  has  somehow  affected  the  site  and  has,  as  a  result,  altered  or
destroyed  Phillips's works."' 8

What Phillips leaves  open, then, is  whether  site-specific  art  or  land
art is  copyrightable  at all. One  possible  reading  of Phillips suggests that
the  court's  concern  with modification  or destruction-and  ownership,  in
general--could  nonetheless  qualify  land art  as  an architectural  work,  for
which  "the  owners  of a building  embodying  an  architectural  work  may,
without the  consent  of the author  or  copyright  owner of the  architectural
work, make  or authorize  the  making  of alterations  to such building,  and
destroy  or  authorize  the  destruction  of such building. ' 49 This  exception
nicely  satisfies  the  First  Circuit's  concern  with  property  ownership,  as
the  Act's  divorce  of  building  from  copyrightable  work  (in  which  a

the  artwork  itself, and  the building to the site that  surrounds  it.

Phillips, then,  was  at least  hinting  at one  viable  option  for placing
land  art  more  firmly  within  the  architectural  medium-for 
legal
purposes,  at  least.  But,  in  a  more  recent  case  involving  land  art,  the
Seventh  Circuit  firmly  moved  in  an  even  more  radical  direction-
declaring  the uncopyrightability  of land art, period.5°

If Phillips presented  a question  of medium  categorization,  in  which
defining  land  art  as architecture  (or, at least,  as  not-sculpture)  may  entail
losing  certain  rights  that  sculptures  are  subject  to,  Kelley,  instead,
eschews  the  issue  for  the  very  basics  of  copyrightability-the  idea-
expression

requirement. 51 The  case  centered  around  a wildflower  garden  created by
the  artist  Chapman  Kelley. 52  Wildflower  Works  consisted  of  "two
enormous  elliptical  flowerbeds,  each  nearly  as  big  as  a  football  field,
featuring  a  variety  of  native  wildflowers  and  edged  with  borders  of
gravel  and  steel. 53  Wildflower  Works  immediately  calls  to  mind  other

at  all-a  question  of medium.  "To  qualify  for  moral-rights  protection
under VARA,  Wildflower Works  cannot just be 'pictorial'  or  'sculptural'
in  some aspect  or effect,  it must actually  be a  'painting'  or a 'sculpture.'
Not  metaphorically  or  by  analogy,  but  really,"  the  court  writes.58
Unfortunately,  the court  never  articulates just  what about  a  work  makes
it  "really"  a  painting  or  sculpture,  rather  than having  mere  "sculptural"
or "pictorial"  qualities.  Perhaps,  in order  to  avoid  the  more  vexing  issue
of determining just what each  medium  is,  the  court moves  on to  a  more
basic  (and  seemingly  simpler)  question:  whether  the  work  can  be
copyrighted  at all,  as  "a  living  garden  lacks  the  kind  of authorship  and
stable  fixation  normally  required  to  support  copyright."59  The  first,  the
court  maintains,  is  true  because  much  of  Wildflower  Works  owes  its
form  to  nature-"the  colors,  shapes,  textures,  and  scents  of the  plants
originates  in nature,  not  in the  mind of the  gardener  [the derivative  term
they  have  now  bestowed  upon  Chapman]., 60  The  second,  that  the  work
is  not  fixed,  is  also  true,  the  court  opines,  because  "[a]  garden's
constituent  elements  are  alive  and  inherently  changeable,  not  fixed." 61
Because  the work  is unable  to cross  even the most basic of all  copyright
hurdles-originality  and  fixation--Chapman  does  not  own  a  copyright,
let  alone moral rights, in the  work.

that 

led 

the  court 

Yet  this  reasoning  is  somewhat  attenuated,  suggesting  a  deep
discomfort  with  medium 
to  address  a  more
straightforward  question  about  fixation  instead.  However, the  idea that a
living  garden  lacks  fixation  would  also  call  into  question  much  of
sculpture  made  from  materials  meant  to  degrade  or  wear  over  time-
even  man-made  ones,  like  steel.  The  sculptures  of Richard  Serra,  for
example,  are  not  constant,  stable,  and  unchanging-but  are  intended  to
register  the  marks  and wear  of life  as  the  steel  ages,  changing  in  color
and  texture  throughout  the years.62  In this sense,  even more  "traditional"
sculpture  is  not  "fixed"  under  the  court's  definition.  And  ruling  out
flowers  as merely an "idea"  of nature  seems  silly, to say the least.  Plenty
of  sculptures  depend  on  natural  materials-sand,  for  example,  in  the
sculptures  of Joseph  Beuys-for their existence.63

All  of this  suggests  that  what  we are  really getting  at  in  both  these
opinions  are  basic  assumptions  about  what  sculpture-and  really,  art-
is. As  I  argue  in  the  following  Part, judges'  natural  distrust  of land  art
owes  much  to  modernism's  insistence  on  purity  of art  form-meant  to
be  placed  in  the  museum,  free  from the  every  day,  and transcendent  in
its aspirations. 64

III.  COPYRIGHT  IN THE  EXPANDED  FIELD:  WHAT COPYRIGHT  LAW

OWES TO  MODERNIST  MEDIUM  SPECIFICITY

I suggested  earlier  that  copyright  law,  like  modernism,  focuses  on
distilling  a medium  down  to  its  inherent  end  logic. 65  Yet,  both  Phillips
and Kelley seem less  guided by what  sculpture  or painting  is, rather than
an almost intuitive,  implicit idea of what  it is not. And yet,  what are both
courts  so  convinced  that  art  should not  be? For this,  we  turn  to  another
great  modernist  critic,  Michael  Fried,  who  famously  set  out  to  define
what  sets  "art"  apart  from  mere  "objects"  in  his  1967  essay,  Art  and
Objecthood.66  For, if this Article  had begun by positing that perhaps  it is
not just the  nineteenth  century  notion  of the romantic  author-genius  that
copyright  law  owes  its  debt  to,  but  its  twentieth  century  avant-garde
successors,  a  re-reading  of Fried's  essay  garners  unexpected  parallels
between the rhetoric  of the Kelley court and high-modernist  mantra.

Fried,  in  his  polemic  against  minimalist  art,  termed  the  works  of
well-known  minimalist  artists-such  as  Donald  Judd,  Carl  Andre,  and
Robert  Morris-objects, not  artworks.67  Inspired  by Greenberg's  earlier
rant  against  minimalism,  in  which  he argued  that  "[m]inimal  works  are
readable  as art, as  almost anything  is today-including  a door, a table, or
a blank sheet of paper,, 68 Fried takes this new "condition  of non-art"  and
calls  it  "objecthood. ' '69  "It  is  as  though  objecthood  alone  can,  in  the
present  circumstances,  secure  something's  identity,  if not  as  nonart,  at
least as neither painting nor sculpture; or as  though a work of art-more
accurately,  a  work  of modernist  painting  or  sculpture-were  in  some

essential  respect  not an  object."7  Here,  we  see  Fried  and  Greenberg
visibly  working  to  categorize  the  new  sculpture  as  something  other
than--other  than  painting,  other  than  sculpture,  maybe  non-art,  at  best
an  object-just  as  the  Kelley  court  expressed  suspicion  at  granting
VARA protection  to something  that  did not  fit neatly into  the traditional
category  of painting qua painting  or sculpture  qua sculpture. The  court's
categorization  of  Wildflower  Works  as  merely  having  "sculptural"  or
"painterly"  qualities  turns  what  Krauss  had  termed 
the  expanded
sculpture's  negation-as-positive  into  a  negation-as-negative  (surely how
Greenberg  and  Fried  would  see  it):  "not-sculpture"  or  "not-painting"
does  not  merely  expand  into  a  quaternary  field  of  "not-sculpture  as
painting"  or  "not-painting  as  sculpture.' 
Rather,  "not-sculpture"  or
"not-painting"  becomes, simply, not-art.

Yet why  is this so?  Why is  Fried  so eager to categorize  minimalism
as not-art,  as condemned to "objecthood"  status?  Similarly,  how does the
Kelley court  come  to the  conclusion  that  Wildflower  Works,  too,  is  not-
art,  but  at  best a  garden,  an ordinary  work of landscaping  in the  middle
of  a  public  park?  Surprisingly,  we  can  view  the  justifications  both
provided as one  and the same.  That is,  we can read the  Seventh  Circuit's
anxiety  over  the  "not  fixed,"  intangible  nature  of  Wildflower  Works  as
parallel to Fried's distrust of the  "endlessness"  of minimalist sculpture.

"Endlessness,"  Fried  writes,  or  the  condition  of "being  able  to  go
on  and on, even  having to go  on and  on, is central both to the  concept  of
interest  and  to  that of objecthood. ' '72 And  so,  in many  ways,  experience
blurs  art  and  life,  just  as  minimalist  objects  are  not  self-contained,  but
rely  on the viewer,  on the room,  on the  atmosphere,  and  the  sounds,  air,
and  light  themselves  for their  effect.  Certainly,  Smithson's  Spiral  Jetty
takes  the  idea  of art  as  experience,  or  art-blurred-into-life,  to  its  next
logical  progression,  as  viewers  travel  along  the  length  of the  Jetty one
step at a  time  in the long journey towards  its  center. In  person,  the Jetty
is not  viewable  in  an  instant;  it  cannot  be  grasped  as  a  whole.  And  no
two  individual's  experience  of the  work  will  be  the  same-the  Jetty,
whether  submerged, re-emerged,  laced with  rain, or dry from drought,  is
inextricably  linked  with  atmosphere,  with  the  time  of  day,  and  the
workings  of the  weather.  As  such,  it,  like  the  works  of its  minimalist
predecessors  that Fried railed against,  lacks the  "presentness ... that one
experiences  as  a  kind of  instantaneousness, as  though  if only  one were
infinitely  more  acute,  a  single  infinitely  brief  instant  would  be  long

enough  to  see  everything,  to  experience  the  work  in  all  its  depth  and
fullness,  to be forever convinced by it."73

It  is  this  instantaneousness  that  modernist  art  aspires  toward  (as  in
the  works  of Kenneth  Noland,  Jules  Olitski,  David  Smith,  or  Anthony
Caro,  in  which  "at every  moment  the  work  itself is  wholly  manifest,"
contends  Fried),74  and  this  instantaneousness 
that  minimalist  objects
lack.  For the  latter,  "the  experience  in  question persists in time, and  the
presentment  of endlessness. 
. . is essentially  a presentment  of endless  or
indefinite  duration.75  So  we  return  to  the  Kelley  court's  emphasis  on
"fixation  in  a  tangible  medium,"  which  now  manifests  itself  as  an
understanding  of  art  as  precisely  Fried's  modernist  notion  of
instantaneousness.  A  work  of art,  in  other  words,  should not  persist  in
time,  but  should be fixed in  one  moment-a  brief  instant  that captures
the  work  in  all  its  depth  and  fullness,  in  its  one-ness  and  wholeness,
forever.  A  work  of art  cannot  go  on  and  on,  ever-changing,  inherently
alive  as  the  flowers  in  Chapman's  work.  It  is  this  suspicion  of  the
intangibility  of experience  itself that the Kelley court  seems  to abhor, the
idea  that  art  may  expand  beyond  the  object  itself  to  encompass  the
conditions  of life  and time.  Somewhere  in here  we may read the  mystic's
hope  for  immortality,  for  transcendence.  Art  should  endure  even  as  we
must  die.  Hence,  Fried  disdains  minimalist  art,  calling  it  "literalist"
instead,  in  what  could  be  a direct  evocation  of the  drabness  of life  that
art  should  aim  to  transcend. 76  "We  are  all  literalists  most  or  all  of our
lives,"  Fried writes.77  But "[p]resentness  is grace. 78

The  decisions  in Phillips and Kelley, while  they have been  roundly
criticized  by  the  art  law  community,  seem  to  reach  the  most  logical
conclusion  regarding  the  vexed  relationship  between  the new  expanded
sculpture  and  moral  rights.  After  all,  work  that  invites  modification  or

COP YRIGHT IN THE EXPANDED FIELD

Jetty, for  example,  or  a  plucked  flower  from  Chapman's  Wildflower
Works-cannot then  claim  the  right  to  be  free  from  modification  or
alteration.  Similarly,  land  art's communitarian  function  suggests  at least
some  need  for a  balancing  of rights  between  public  interest  and  artistic
control-both  Phillips  and  Kelley,  after  all,  involved  highly  public
works  in  city parks.  Like  architecture,  which serves  a public  function as
a  monument  or tourist  attraction,  it  would  seem at  least  reasonable  that
the  public  remain  free  to  photograph  large  works  of land  art,  even  if
protected  by copyright.  All  of which might  lead  one to suggest:  why not
just  definitively  categorize  land  art  as  architecture?  We  would,  hence,
solve  both  the  moral  rights  problem  (as  architectural  works  are  not
protected  under  VARA)  and allow  for  public  engagement  with  these
highly visible works  in the  form of a pictorial representation  exception.79
Moreover, 
already  acknowledged
the  architectural  influences  in  their  work,  so  the  analogue  seems  a
natural  one.8°

land  artists  have 

themselves 

And  yet,  some  would  argue  that  the  right  to  control  how,  for
example,  the  Jetty appears  in  photographs  and  films  is  as  important  or
more  important  than  the Jetty itself-after  all, most  of us  only  know  the
Jetty as  a  "neatly  framed...  striking  still  photographic  image  that  is
endlessly  reproduced  as  the  preferred  symbol,  elegant  and  concise,  for
'earth  art.' 81  However, the question  in this  instance  necessarily  becomes
case-by-case:  a widely-circulated,  unauthorized  image  of the Jetty might
forever  tarnish  its  reputation,  but  a  relatively  unknown  photograph
published  by  a  tourist  on  his  blog  might  not  affect  the  Jetty's public
image at all.

I  suggest  that  artists  working  with  the  new  sculpture 

in  the
expanded  field  similarly  expand  their  legal  remedies  beyond that  of
copyright  law  to  land  art's  natural  analogue:  real  property  law,  and  the
doctrines  of trespass and  nuisance.  The  former goes  straight to  the heart
of ownership rights, and the  latter to rights of the public.

B.  Trespass as  One Form of Creative Control

The  doctrine  of trespass  is probably the  more  straightforward  of the
two.  It  acknowledges  that  owners  have  a  "bundle"  of  rights  to  their
property,  including  the  right  to  exclude  others  from  entering  and  the

drop  in,  look  around,  and  snap  photos.  Rather,  access  to  and  from
Lightning Field is  tightly  controlled by Dia,  which ferries  visitors  to the
site  only upon a  two-night  stay.8 3 Further,  Dia is  explicit about  retaining
the  right  to  control  the  way  Lightning Field appears  in  photos.84  This
makes  sense  for works  like  de  Maria's,  as  the  poles  of Lightning Field
undoubtedly  look  best  when  struck  with  lightning  and  lit  up  against  a
dark night  sky.  Dia,  therefore,  does  not  need  a  copyright  claim  to  ban
any  unauthorized  photos  of  Lightning Field-it can  simply  assert  a
breach of contract action, as every visitor to the  site has  explicitly  agreed
not to publish any such photos.

However,  Dia's  approach  to Lightning Field does  not transfer  over
as  well  to, for  instance,  the  Spiral Jetty context,  as  the  sheer  mass  of it
makes the object  visible from the air. Thus,  even if Dia could easily  limit
what visitors  do  on  the ground, it could  not contract  with those  chance
passersby  who  spot  the  Jetty  from  above  and  snap  a  few  photos  of it.
The  same  applies  to  other  mass-scale  earthworks  visible  (really  only
viewable  as whole)  from  above,  like Heizer's  Effigy  Tumuli-a massive
compilation  of earth  mounds  made  to  resemble  creatures  when  viewed
from the air.

Furthermore,  as  noted  above,  trespass  works  only  when 

the
interests  of the  artist  and  the  landowner  are  perfectly  aligned.  It  should
be every  land artist's  hope that if he  does not himself own the  land, then
at  least  whoever  does  will  act  in  the  best  interest  of the  work,  neither
destroying it nor altering it for the worse, and working  to ensure that any
unauthorized,  unfavorable  reproduction  in  film  or photograph  is halted.
In  a world  in  which  we  expect  property  owners  to  behave  like  rational
actors,  working  diligently  to  increase  and  preserve  property  value,  this
should  not be  an  unrealistic  expectation.  Yet,  the  current  legal  troubles

about the future  of land art.86

In  the  absence  of legal  ownership  of the land  on which  the art  sits,
artists  hoping  to  preserve  a  certain  degree  of control  over  their  works
must look past the simpler  gate-keeping  methods of trespass  and  contract

law,  dating 

Nuisance  as  a real  property  injury  is  a relatively  new  development
in  Anglo-American 
to  the  beginning  of  the  twentieth
century. 88 Unlike  trespass,  which  is  a hard-and-fast  rule  with bright-line
applicability  (any  unauthorized  trespass  upon  a  land 
is  de  facto
wrongful), 89  nuisance  is  a  balancing  test  conducted  by  judges  that
weighs the competing  interests  of both parties. 90  And, unlike  trespass,  no
physical intrusion  is necessary;  intangible  intrusions,  like  dust  particles,
light, air,  and noise,  can  constitute  an  actionable  invasion.91 Courts have
defined  a  nuisance  as  "anything  which  interferes  with  the  rights  of a
citizen,  either  in person,  property,  the  enjoyment  of his  property,  or  his
comfort .... A  condition  is  a  nuisance when  it  clearly appears that

Consider  the  other  exclusive  rights  a  land  artist  could  assert  if  he  held  a  copyright:  the  right  to
prepare  derivative  works  and  the right  to display  his  work.  However,  land  art's  invitation  to  the
public to interact with  the artwork renders a prohibition  on  derivative works  impractical  and, likely,
directly inapposite  to the artist's intentions,  while the work's immovable  state  means that it can  only
be displayed  in the one place  it was built-the  intended  site.

enjoyment of property is materially lessened.,92 Courts  will  balance  the
landowner's  interest  in  the  enjoyment  of  his  property  with  the  social
value of the activity alleged to  cause the harm.93

the  plaintiff  is  entitled 

Activities  such as  air pollution  emitting  from  a nearby  factory  onto
homeowners'  land,  and  noxious  gas  issuing  from  a  smelting  plant  that
substantially  damaged  plaintiffs'  hedges  and  shrubs,  have  been
enjoined.94  Further, 
to  monetary  damages
stemming  from  "the  depreciation  in  the  market  value  of the  property
injured"  (a  "diminution  of the  value"  standard).95  I argue,  then,  that  a
nuisance  cause  of action  is  just  as  apt  in  the  land  art  context,  where
publication  of  photographs  or  films  that  misrepresent,  distort,  or
otherwise  present  works  like  the  Jetty  unfavorably--detracting  from
their  overall  appeal-can  cause  irreparable  damage  to  the  value  of the
artworks  themselves,  and,  therefore,  such  publication  constitutes  a
nuisance  that  must be enjoined.

While  almost  all  nuisance  cases 

to  date  have  balanced  a
homeowner's  right  to  the  enjoyment  of  his  property  against  another
party's  right  to  carry  on  some  arguably  harmful  activity,  a  land  art
owner's  right to the  enjoyment  of his property  is fundamentally  different
from  that  of a resident.  Specifically,  the value  of his property  lies  in  its
public presentation, and  it is mostly through  the dissemination  and mass
circulation  of images  or  film that favorable  public regard  is garnered  to  a
remote  work  of land  art  otherwise  only  accessible  via  pilgrimage.  The
owner  of  a  work  of  land  art,  unlike  a  homeowner,  does  not  derive
enjoyment  from living  peaceably  on  the property-which,  in the  case  of
homeowners,  provided  justifications  for  categorizing  noise,  pollution,
and  noxious  gases  as  nuisances.  Rather,  land  art  owners  derive
enjoyment solely  from the  good reputation  (translating directly  to  higher
market  value)  the  work enjoys. 96  For the  same  reasons  that a  loud  plant
operation  must  be  enjoined  if it  interferes  with  a  homeowner's  right  to
quiet enjoyment,  the  mass-scale  circulation  of unfavorable, unauthorized
photographs  must  be  prohibited  to prevent  the  depreciation  in  value  of
the art owner's property.

COPYRIGHT IN THE EXPANDED FIELD

Using  nuisance  in  lieu  of copyright  essentially  weighs  the  same
balancing  interests  that  the  latter  already  takes  into  account.  That  is,
copyright  is  not  an  absolute  monopoly.  The  fair  use  doctrine,  which
allows  the  appropriation  of a  copyrighted  work  in  limited  instances,  is,
like  nuisance  law,  a  balancing  test  that  weighs  the  interest  of  the
copyright  holder  against  the  interest  of the  defendant.97 The  four-factor
fair  use  test  weighs  the  purpose  and  character  of  the  infringing  use
(whether  it  is  transformative-that  is,  adding  "new  aesthetics,  new
insights  and  understandings"  to  the  original  work)98 with  the  nature  of
the  copyrighted  work  (fictional  works  get  more  copyright  protection
than  nonfictional  works), 99 the  amount  of the work  taken, and  the  effect
of the  infringing use  on the  market or value  of the copyrighted  work. 100

the 

same  considerations 

into  play.  Specifically, 

A  nuisance  balancing  test  applied  in  the  art  context  would  take
much  of 
the
"nuisance"-an  unauthorized  representation  in  the  form  of a  photo  or
film-must be  harmful  in  some way,  and,  as in  fair use,  severely  affect
the  market  or  value  of the  work  (the  "diminution  of value"  standard)
without  adding  any  tangible  benefits  or  transformative  value.  Such  a
requirement  recognizes  that  there  is  a  broad  public  interest  in  art  that
copyright  law  itself  acknowledges  and  serves-the  public  interest  in
being  enriched,  in  appropriating  knowledge,  and  in building  off  of the
works of others  in order to create  more  works.  By balancing  the rights of
the  real  property  owner  and  the  social  value  of  the  activity  said  to
constitute  a nuisance, nuisance  law  strangely mimics  fair use's balancing
test  of the rights  of the  copyright  holder  against  the social  value  of the
new,  infringing work.

We  can  also  see  this  concern  with  balancing  public  good  and
private  rights  in the unfavorable  treatment  Kelley  and  Phillips accorded
site-specific  art.  Underlying  both  courts'  reluctance  to  allow  the  artists
complete  control  of  these  works,  installed  and  displayed  on  public
grounds,  could  be  the  fact that  these  works  were  precisely  that-public
art,  sponsored  and  owned  by  the  city,  and  created  with  public  funds.  If
copyright  law  was  already  deeply  concerned  with  the  appropriate
balancing  of a  right  holder's  monopoly  power and  the  public  interest  in
art's  progress  (specifically,  the  Constitution's  Copyright  Clause  allows

At  last, it may seem  obvious but nonetheless  bears  pointing  out that
the  doctrine  of nuisance,  unlike  fair  use,  does  not  require  that  the  new
use  be  valuable  at  all.  We  might  analogize  nuisance  law's  requirement
that  any  interference  with  an  owner's  property  be  substantial  to  the
doctrine  of de  minimis use  in  copyright  law.  That  is,  trivial  uses  (like

reproducing  an

Jetty from  a personal  trip  and  posted  on  one's  travel  blog, for  example,
are  likely so  de minimis as to constitute  a  non-nuisance.  In  that instance,
an  artist  cannot  argue  that  such  a  reproduction  has  materially  interfered

V. 

CONCLUSION

Some  great  works  of land  art  will no  doubt become  as iconic  as the
natural  wonders  that  draw  visitors  from  around  the  world  each  year.
Smithson's  man-made Jetty could, thus,  easily rival the  Grand  Canyon in
the  years  to come.  But the  future  of the Jetty-including  its  status  as  a
copyrightable  artwork-is hard  to predict.

The  continued  development  of these  works  in  the  expanded  field
must  similarly  expand  beyond  the  modernism-inflected,  medium-
specific,  and self-contained  ethos of copyright  law. To  be like  life,  to be
in  the  everyday,  and  to  expand  the  realm  of  possibility,  the  new
sculpture  must necessarily  appropriate  legal remedies  once  thought of as
more fitting  for homeowners  than for  artists;  for  real,  grounded  property
rather  than  for  intellectual  property.  Similarly,  courts  should  remain
open  to these  untraditional  remedies  as  one  way  of addressing  the  non-
fixed,  land/art  hybrid of the  new  expanded  medium.' °4 These  remedies,
of  course,  are  imperfect:  as  with  Chapman's  Wildflower  Works  and
Phillips's  stoneworks,  the artwork  owner's  interests  may  be opposed  to
the  artist's  interests,  and,  in  many best-case  scenarios,  artists  must  rely

and  preservation  of  artworks.' 0 5  But,  then  again,  life  itself,  which
earthworks  take  as  their  base,  is  imperfect.  The  desire  for  absolute
control  over  a work  of one's  own,  like  the  desire  to  leave  one's  mark-
etched  in  larger-scale  format, permanent  for  now,  and hopefully  for  all
time-on  the  world,  is  a  natural,  albeit  megalomaniacal,  human  urge.
