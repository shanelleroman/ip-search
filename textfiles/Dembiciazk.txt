Before MAYER, Chief Judge, MICHEL and CLEVENGER, Circuit Judges. 
 
CLEVENGER, Circuit Judge. 

Anita Dembiczak and Benson Zinbarg appeal the rejection, upheld by the Board of 

Patent Appeals and Interferences, of all pending claims in their Application No. 08/427,732. 

 See Ex Parte Dembiczak, No. 96-2648, slip op. at 43 (May 14, 1998).  Because the Board 

erred in sustaining rejections of the pending claims as obvious under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) 

(Supp. 1998), and for obviousness-type double patenting, we reverse. 

 

I 

The invention at issue in this case is, generally speaking, a large trash bag made of 

orange  plastic  and  decorated  with  lines  and  facial  features,  allowing the bag, when filled 

with  trash  or  leaves,  to  resemble  a  Halloween-style  pumpkin,  or  jack-o’-lantern.    As  the 
98-1498 

2 

 

inventors,  Anita  Dembiczak  and  Benson  Zinbarg  (collectively,  “Dembiczak”)  note,  the 

invention solves the long-standing problem of unsightly trash bags placed on the curbs of 

America,  and,  by  fortuitous  happenstance,  allows  users  to  express  their  whimsical  or 

festive  nature  while  properly  storing  garbage,  leaves,  or  other  household  debris  awaiting 

collection.  Embodiments of the invention--sold under a variety of names, including Giant 

Stuff-A-Pumpkin™, Funkins, Jack Sak™, and Bag-O-Fun™--have undisputedly been well-

received by consumers, who bought more than seven million units in 1990 alone.  Indeed, 

in 1990, the popularity of the pumpkin bags engendered a rash of thefts around Houston, 

Texas, leading some owners to resort to preventative measures, such as greasing the bags 

with petroleum jelly and tying them to trees.  See R. Piller, “Halloween Hopes Die on the 

Vine,” Hous. Chron., Oct. 19, 1990, at 13A.  

The road to profits has proved much easier than the path to patentability, however.  

In July 1989, Dembiczak filed a utility patent application generally directed to the pumpkin 

bags.    In  a  February  1992  appeal,  the  Board  of  Patent  Appeals  and  Interferences  (“the 

Board”)  reversed  the  Examiner’s  rejection,  but  entered  new  grounds  for  rejection.  

Dembiczak elected to continue prosecution, filing a continuation application to address the 

new grounds for rejection.  Thereafter, the invention made a second appearance before the 

Board,  in  April  1993,  when  the  Board  both  sustained  the Examiner’s rejection and again 

entered new grounds for rejection.  Again, a continuation application was filed (the instant 

application).    And  again  the  Examiner’s  rejection  was  appealed  to  the  Board,  which 

sustained the rejection in a May 14, 1998, decision.  See Dembiczak, slip op. at 43.

The patent application at issue includes claims directed to various embodiments of 

the pumpkin bag.  Claims 37, 49, 51, 52, 58 through 64, 66 through 69, and 72 through 81 

are at issue in this appeal.  Though the claims vary, independent claim 74 is perhaps most 

representative: 

74. 

A  decorative  bag  for use by a user with trash filling material, the 
bag simulating the general outer appearance of an outer surface of a 
pumpkin having facial indicia thereon, comprising: 

a flexible waterproof plastic trash or leaf bag having  
 
an outer surface which is premanufactured orange in color for the user 
to simulate the general appearance of the outer skin of a pumpkin, and 
having  
 
facial indicia including at least two of an eye, a nose and a mouth on 
the  orange  color  outer  surface  for  forming  a  face  pattern  on  said 
orange color outer surface to simulate the general outer appearance of 
a decorative pumpkin with a face thereon,  
 
said trash or leaf bag having first and second opposite ends, at least 
said second end having an opening extending substantially across the 
full width of said trash or leaf bag for receiving the trash filling material,  
 
wherein when said trash or leaf bag is filled with trash filling material 
and  closed,  said  trash  or  leaf  bag  takes  the  form  and  general 
appearance of a pumpkin with a face thereon. 

All  of  the  independent  claims  on  appeal,  namely  37,  52,  72,  and  74,  contain 

 

 

limitations  that  the  bag  must  be  “premanufactured  orange  in  color,”  have  “facial  indicia,” 

have openings suitable for filling with trash material, and that when filled, the bag must have 

a generally rounded appearance, like a pumpkin.  Independent claims 37, 52, and 72 add 

the limitation that the bag’s height must at least 36 inches.  Claim 72 requires that the bag 

be made of a “weatherproof material,” and claim 74, as shown above, requires that the bag 

98-1498 

4 

 

be  “waterproof.”    Claim  52  recites  a  “method  of  assembling”  a  bag  with  the  general 

characteristics of apparatus claim 37.   

The prior art cited by the Board includes:  

B 

(1)  

pages  24-25  of  a  book  entitled  “A  Handbook  for  Teachers  of 

Elementary Art,” by Holiday Art Activities (“Holiday”), describing how to 

teach children to make a “Crepe Paper Jack-O-Lantern” out of a strip 

of  orange  crepe  paper,  construction  paper  cut-outs  in  the  shape  of 

facial features, and “wadded newspapers” as filling; 

(2)  

page  73  of  a  book  entitled  “The  Everything  Book  for  Teachers  of 

Young  Children,”  by  Martha  Shapiro  and  Valerie 

Indenbaum 

(“Shapiro”), describing a method of making a “paper bag pumpkin” by 

stuffing a bag with newspapers, painting it orange, and then painting 

on facial features with black paint; 

(3)   U.S.  Patent  No.  3,349,991  to  Leonard  Kessler,  entitled  “Flexible 

Container”  (“Kessler”),  describing  a  bag  apparatus  wherein  the  bag 

closure  is  accomplished  by  the  use  of  folds  or  gussets  in  the  bag 

material; 

(4)   U.S. Patent No. Des. 310,023, issued August 21, 1990 to Dembiczak 

(“Dembiczak  ‘023”),  a  design  patent  depicting    a  bag with a jack-o’-

lantern face; 

98-1498 

5 

 

(5)   U.S.  Patent  No.  Des.  317,254,  issued  June  4,  1991  to  Dembiczak 

(“Dembiczak  ‘254”),  a  design  patent  depicting  a  bag  with  a  jack-o’-

lantern face; and, 

(6)   Prior  art  “conventional”  plastic  lawn  or  trash  bags  (“the  conventional 

trash bags”). 

Using  this  art,  the  Board  affirmed  the  Examiner’s  final  rejection  of  all  the  independent 

claims (37, 52, 72, 74) under 35 U.S.C. § 103, holding that they would have been obvious 

in light of the conventional trash bags in view of the Holiday and Shapiro references.  The 

Board determined that, in its view of the prior art, “the only difference between the invention 

presently defined in the independent claims on appeal and the orange plastic trash bags of 

the prior art and the use of such bags resides in the application of the facial indicia to the 

outer  surface  of  the  bag.”    Dembiczak,  slip  op.  at  18.    The  Board  further  held  that  the 

missing  facial  indicia  elements  were  provided  by  the  Holiday  and  Shapiro  references’ 

description of painting jack-o’-lantern faces on paper bags.  See id. at 18-19.  Dependent 

claims  49  and  79,  which  include  a  “gussets”  limitation,  were  considered  obvious  under 

similar reasoning, except that the references cited against them included Kessler.  See id. 

at 7. 

The Board also affirmed the Examiner’s obviousness-type double patenting rejection 

of all the independent claims in light of the two Dembiczak design patents (‘023 and ‘254) 

and  Holiday.    See  id.  at  12.    The  Board  held  that  the  design  patents  depict  a  generally 

rounded bag with jack-o’-lantern facial indicia, and that the Holiday reference supplies the 

missing limitations, such as the “thin, flexible material” of manufacture, the orange color, the 

initially-open  upper  end,  and  the  trash  filling  material.    The  Board  also  stated  that  the 
98-1498 

6 

 

various limitations of the dependent claims--e.g., color, the inclusion of leaves as stuffing, 

and  the  dimensions--would  all  be  obvious  variations  of  the  depictions  in  the  Dembiczak 

design  patents.    See  id.  at  8-9.    In  addition,  using  a  two-way  test  for  obviousness-type 

double patenting, the Board held that the claims of the Dembiczak design patents “do not 

exclude”  the  additional  structural  limitations  of  the  pending  utility  claims,  and  thus  the 

design patents were merely obvious variations of the subject matter disclosed in the utility 

claims.  See id. at  11.  The Board further upheld, on similar grounds and with the inclusion 

of  the  Kessler  reference,  the  obviousness-type  double  patenting  rejection  of  dependent 

claim 49.  See id. at 12. 

This  appeal  followed,  vesting  this  court  with  jurisdiction  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C. 

§ 1295(a)(4)(A) (1994). 

 
II 

A claimed invention is unpatentable if the differences between it and the prior art “are 

such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention 

was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art.”  35 U.S.C. § 103(a) (Supp. 1998); 

see Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 14, 148 USPQ 459, 465 (1966).  The ultimate 

determination  of whether an invention is or is not obvious is a legal conclusion based on 

underlying factual inquiries including: (1) the scope and content of the prior art; (2) the level 

of ordinary skill in the prior art; (3) the differences between the claimed invention and the 

prior art; and (4) objective evidence of nonobviousness.  See Graham, 383 U.S. at 17-18, 

148 USPQ at 467; Miles Labs, Inc., Inc. v. Shandon Inc., 997 F.2d 870, 877, 27 USPQ2d 

1123,  1128  (Fed.  Cir.  1993).    We  therefore  review  the  ultimate  determination  of 

98-1498 

7 

 

obviousness without deference to the Board, while examining any factual findings for clear 

error.  See, e.g., In re Zurko, 142 F.3d 1447, 1459, 46 USPQ2d 1691, 1700 (Fed. Cir.) (en 

banc), cert. granted, 119 S. Ct. 401 (1998). 

A 

Our analysis begins in the text of section 103 quoted above, with the phrase “at the 

time  the  invention  was  made.”    For  it  is  this  phrase  that  guards  against  entry  into  the 

“tempting  but  forbidden  zone  of  hindsight,”  see  Loctite  Corp.  v.  Ultraseal  Ltd.,  781  F.2d 

861, 873, 228 USPQ 90, 98 (Fed. Cir. 1985), overruled on other grounds by Nobelpharma 

AB v. Implant Innovations, Inc., 141 F.3d 1059, 46 USPQ2d 1097 (Fed. Cir. 1998), when 

analyzing the patentability of claims pursuant to that section.  Measuring a claimed invention 

against the standard established by section 103 requires the oft-difficult but critical step of 

casting the mind back to the time of invention, to consider the thinking of one of ordinary 

skill in the art, guided only by the prior art references and the then-accepted wisdom in the 

field.    See,  e.g.,  W.L.  Gore  &  Assoc.,  Inc.  v.  Garlock,  Inc.,  721  F.2d  1540,  1553,  220 

UPSQ  303,  313  (Fed.  Cir.  1983).    Close  adherence  to  this  methodology  is  especially 

important in the case of less technologically complex inventions, where the very ease with 

which the invention can be understood may prompt one “to fall victim to the insidious effect 

of  a  hindsight  syndrome  wherein  that  which  only  the  inventor  taught  is  used  against  its 

teacher.”  Id. 

Our  case  law  makes  clear  that  the  best  defense  against  the  subtle  but  powerful 

attraction  of  a  hindsight-based  obviousness  analysis  is  rigorous  application  of  the 

requirement  for  a  showing  of  the  teaching  or  motivation  to  combine  prior  art  references.  

See, e.g., C.R. Bard, Inc. v. M3 Sys., Inc., 157 F.3d 1340, 1352, 48 USPQ2d 1225, 1232 
98-1498

(Fed.  Cir.  1998)  (describing  “teaching  or  suggestion  or  motivation  [to  combine]”  as  an 

“essential evidentiary component of an obviousness holding”); In re Rouffet, 149 F.3d 1350, 

1359, 47 USPQ2d 1453, 1459 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (“the Board must identify specifically . . . 

the  reasons  one  of  ordinary  skill  in  the  art  would  have  been  motivated  to  select  the 

references and combine them”); In re Fritch, 972 F.2d 1260, 1265, 23 USPQ2d 1780, 1783 

(Fed. Cir. 1992) (examiner can satisfy burden of obviousness in light of combination “only 

by  showing  some  objective  teaching  [leading  to the combination]”);  In re Fine, 837 F.2d 

1071, 1075, 5 USPQ2d 1596, 1600 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (evidence of teaching or suggestion 

“essential” to avoid hindsight);  Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Delta Resins & Refractories, Inc., 776 

F.2d  281,  297,  227  USPQ  657,  667  (Fed.  Cir.  1985)  (district  court’s  conclusion  of 

obviousness  was  error  when  it  ”did  not  elucidate  any  factual  teachings,  suggestions  or 

incentives from this prior art that showed the propriety of combination”).  See also Graham, 

383 U.S. at 18, 148 USPQ at 467 (“strict observance” of factual predicates to obviousness 

conclusion  required).    Combining  prior  art  references  without  evidence  of  such  a 

suggestion, teaching, or motivation simply takes the inventor’s disclosure as a blueprint for 

piecing  together  the  prior  art  to  defeat  patentability--the essence of hindsight.  See, e.g., 

Interconnect Planning Corp. v. Feil, 774 F.2d 1132, 1138, 227 USPQ 543, 547 (Fed. Cir. 

1985) (“The invention must be viewed not with the blueprint drawn by the inventor, but in 

the state of the art that existed at the time.”).  In this case, the Board fell into the hindsight 

trap. 

We  have  noted  that  evidence  of  a  suggestion,  teaching,  or  motivation  to combine 

may flow from the prior art references themselves, the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in 

the art, or, in some cases, from the nature of the problem to be solved, see Pro-Mold & Tool 
98-1498 

9 

 

Co. v. Great Lakes Plastics, Inc., 75 F.3d 1568, 1573, 37 USPQ2d 1626, 1630 (Fed. Cir. 

1996), Para-Ordinance Mfg. v. SGS Imports Intern., Inc., 73 F.3d 1085, 1088, 37 USPQ2d 

1237,  1240  (Fed.  Cir.  1995),  although  “the  suggestion  more  often  comes  from  the 

teachings  of  the  pertinent  references,”  Rouffet,  149  F.3d  at  1355,  47 USPQ2d  at  1456.  

The  range  of  sources  available,  however,  does  not  diminish  the  requirement  for  actual 

evidence.    That  is,  the  showing  must  be  clear  and  particular.    See,  e.g.,  C.R.  Bard, 

157 F.3d  at  1352,  48  USPQ2d  at  1232.    Broad  conclusory  statements  regarding  the 

teaching  of  multiple  references,  standing  alone,  are  not  “evidence.”    E.g.,  McElmurry  v. 

Arkansas  Power  &  Light  Co.,  995  F.2d  1576,  1578,  27 USPQ2d  1129,  1131  (Fed.  Cir. 

1993) (“Mere denials and conclusory statements, however, are not sufficient to establish a 

genuine issue of material fact.”); In re Sichert, 566 F.2d 1154, 1164, 196 USPQ 209, 217 

(CCPA 1977) (“The examiner's conclusory statement that the specification does not teach 

the  best  mode  of  using  the invention is unaccompanied by evidence or reasoning and is 

entirely inadequate to support the rejection.”).  In addition to demonstrating the propriety of 

an obviousness analysis, particular factual findings regarding the suggestion, teaching, or 

motivation to combine serve a number of important purposes, including: (1) clear explication 

of  the  position  adopted  by  the  Examiner  and  the  Board;  (2)  identification  of  the  factual 

disputes,  if  any,  between  the  applicant  and  the  Board;  and  (3)  facilitation  of  review  on 

appeal.  Here, however, the Board did not make particular findings regarding the locus of 

the suggestion, teaching, or motivation to combine the prior art references. 

All the obviousness rejections affirmed by the Board resulted from a combination of 

prior art references, e.g., the conventional trash or yard bags, and the Holiday and Shapiro 

publications teaching the construction of decorated paper bags.  See Dembiczak, slip op. at 
98-1498 

10 

 

6-7.    To  justify  this  combination,  the  Board  simply  stated  that  “the  Holiday  and  Shapiro 

references would have suggested the application of . . . facial indicia to the prior art plastic 

trash bags.”  Id. at 18-19.  However, rather than pointing to specific information in Holiday 

or  Shapiro  that  suggest  the  combination  with  the  conventional  bags,  the  Board  instead 

described  in  detail  the  similarities  between  the  Holiday  and  Shapiro  references  and  the 

claimed  invention,  noting  that  one  reference  or  the  other--in  combination  with  each other 

and the conventional trash bags--described all of the limitations of the pending claims.  See 

id.  at  18-28.    Nowhere  does  the  Board  particularly  identify  any  suggestion,  teaching,  or 

motivation  to  combine  the  children’s  art  references  (Holiday  and  Shapiro)  with  the 

conventional  trash  or  lawn  bag  references,  nor  does  the  Board  make  specific--or  even 

inferential--findings concerning the identification of the relevant art, the level of ordinary skill 

in the art, the nature of the problem to be solved, or any other factual findings that might 

serve  to  support  a  proper  obviousness  analysis.    See,  e.g.,  Pro-Mold & Tool, 75 F.3d at 

1573, 37 USPQ2d at 1630. 

To  the  contrary,  the  obviousness  analysis  in  the  Board’s  decision  is  limited  to  a 

discussion of the ways that the multiple prior art references can be combined to read on the 

claimed invention.  For example, the Board finds that the Holiday bag reference depicts a 

“premanufactured orange” bag material, see Dembiczak, slip op. at 21, finds that Shapiro 

teaches  the  use  of  paper  bags  in  various  sizes,  including  “large”,  see  id.  at  22-23,  and 

concludes  that  the  substitution  of  orange  plastic  for  the  crepe  paper  of  Holiday  and  the 

paper bags of Shapiro would be an obvious design choice, see id. at 24.  Yet this reference-

by-reference,  limitation-by-limitation  analysis  fails  to  demonstrate  how  the  Holiday  and 

Shapiro references teach or suggest their combination with the conventional trash or lawn 
98-1498 

11 

 

bags to yield the claimed invention.  See Rouffet, 149 F.3d at 1357, 47 USPQ2d at 1459 

(noting Board’s failure to explain, when analyzing the prior art, “what specific understanding 

or  technical  principle  .  .  .  would  have  suggested  the  combination”).    Because  we do not 

discern  any  finding  by  the  Board  that  there  was  a  suggestion,  teaching,  or  motivation  to 

combine the prior art references cited against the pending claims, the Board’s conclusion of 

obviousness,  as  a  matter  of  law,  cannot  stand.    See  C.R.  Bard,  157  F.3d  at  1352,  48 

USPQ2d at 1232;  Rouffet, 149 F.3d at 1359, 47 USPQ2d at 1459;  Fritch, 972 F.2d at 

1265, 23 USPQ2d at 1783;  Fine, 837 F.2d at 1075, 5 USPQ2d at 1600;  Ashland Oil, 776 

F.2d at 297, 227 USPQ at 667.  

B 

The Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks (“Commissioner”) attempts to justify 

the Board’s decision on grounds different from that relied upon by the Board, arguing that 

one of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to combine the references.  Of 

course,  in  order  to  do  so,  the  Commissioner  must  do  what  the  Board  did  not  do  below: 

make  specific  findings  of  fact  regarding  the  level  of  skill  in  the  art  (“a  designer  and 

manufacturer  of  trash  and  leaf  bags,  particularly  one  specializing  in  the  ornamental  and 

graphic  design  of  such  bags”),  Resp’t  Br.  at  14,  the  relationship  between  the  fields  of 

conventional  trash  bags  and children’s crafts, respectively (“[t]he artisan would also have 

been well aware of the ancillary, corollary, and atypical uses of ‘trash’ bags such as their 

application in hobby and art projects”), Resp’t Br. at 15, and the particular features of the 

prior  art  references  that  would  motivate  one  of  ordinary  skill  in  a  particular  art  to  select 

elements disclosed in references from a wholly different field (“a designer and manufacturer 

of trash and leaf bags would have recognized the paper bag in Shapiro to be a trash bag 
98-1498 

12 

 

and  therefore  would  have been motivated to combine it with the admitted prior art plastic 

trash and leaf bags to arrive at the claimed invention”), Resp’t Br. at 15.  The Commissioner 

also appears to cite additional references in support of his obviousness analysis, noting that 

at least two design patents (in the record but not cited against the presently pending claims) 

teach  the  placement  of  “graphical  information,  including  text,  designs,  and  even  facial 

indicia, to colored bags.”  Resp’t Br. at 16.  This new analysis, apparently cut from whole 

cloth  in  view  of  appeal,  does  little  more  than  highlight  the  shortcomings  of  the  decision 

below,  and  we  decline  to  consider  it.    See,  e.g.,  In  re  Robertson,  169  F.3d  743,  __,  49 

USPQ2d  1949,  1951  (Fed.  Cir.  1999)  (“We  decline  to  consider  [the  Commissioner’s] 

newly-minted theory as an alternative ground for upholding the agency’s decision.”);  In re 

Soni,  54  F.3d  746,  751,  34  USPQ2d  1684,  1688  (Fed.  Cir.  1995);    In  re  Hounsfield, 

699 F.2d 1320, 1324, 216 USPQ 1045, 1049 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (rejecting an “attempt[ ] by 

the Commissioner ‘to apply a new rationale to support the rejection.’”);  see also 35 U.S.C. 

§ 144 (1994) (an appeal to the Federal Circuit “is taken on the record before The Patent 

and  Trademark  Office”).    Because  the  Board  has  not  established  a  prima  facie  case  of 

obviousness, see In re Bell, 991 F.2d 781, 783, 26 USPQ2d 1529, 1531 (Fed. Cir. 1993) 

(“The  PTO  bears  the  burden  of  establishing  a  case  of  prima  facie  obviousness.”),  we 

therefore  reverse  the  obviousness  rejections,  and  have  no  need  to  address  the  parties’ 

arguments with respect to secondary factors. 

 

III 

Dembiczak  also  asks  this  court  to  reverse  the  Board’s  rejection  of  the  pending 

claims  for  obviousness-type  double  patenting,  which  is  a  judicially-created  doctrine  that 

98-1498 

13 

 

seeks to prevent the applicant from expanding the grant of the patent right beyond the limits 

prescribed in Title 35.  See, e.g., In re Braat, 937 F.2d 589, 592, 19 USPQ2d 1289, 1291-

92 (Fed. Cir. 1991); In re Longi, 759 F.2d 887, 892, 225 USPQ 645, 648 (Fed. Cir. 1985).  

See  also  35  U.S.C.  §  154(a)(2)  (Supp.  1998)  (discussing  patent  term).    The  doctrine 

prohibits  claims  in  a  second  patent  which  define  “merely  an  obvious  variation”  of  an 

invention  claimed  by  the  same  inventor  in  an  earlier  patent.    Braat,  937 F.2d  at  592,  19 

USPQ2d  at  1292  (quoting  In  re  Vogel,  422 F.2d 438, 441, 164 USPQ 619, 622 (CCPA 

1970)).    Thus,  unless  a  claim  sought  in  the  later  patent  is  patentably  distinct  from  the 

claims in an earlier patent, the claim must be rejected.  See In re Goodman, 11 F.3d 1046, 

1052, 29 USPQ2d 2010, 2015 (Fed. Cir. 1993); Vogel, 422 F.2d at 441, 164 USPQ at 622. 

 This question is one of law, which we review de novo.  See Goodman, 11 F.3d at 1052, 29 

USPQ2d at 2015; Texas Instruments Inc. v. United States Int’l Trade Comm’n, 988 F.2d 

1165, 1179, 26 USPQ2d 1018, 1029 (Fed. Cir. 1993). 

A 

The law provides that, in some very rare cases, obvious-type double patenting may 

be found between design and utility patents.  See Carman Indus., Inc. v. Wahl, 724 F.2d 

932, 939-40, 220 USPQ 481, 487 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (noting that, while theoretically possible, 

“[d]ouble patenting is rare in the context of utility versus design patents”); In re Thorington, 

418  F.2d  528,  536-37,  163  USPQ  644,  650  (CCPA  1969) (Double patenting between a 

design and utility patent is possible “if the features producing the novel aesthetic effect of a 

design patent or application are the same as those recited in the claims of a utility patent or 

application  as  producing  a novel structure.”); In re Phelan, 205 F.2d 183, 98 USPQ 156 

(CCPA 1953); In re Barber, 81 F.2d 231, 28 USPQ 187 (CCPA 1936); In re Hargraves, 53 
98-1498

F.2d 900, 11 USPQ 240 (CCPA 1931).  In these cases, a “two-way” test is applicable.  See 

Carman, 724 F.2d at 940, 220 USPQ at 487.  Under this test, the obviousness-type double 

patenting rejection is appropriate only if the claims of the two patents cross-read, meaning 

that  “the  test  is  whether  the  subject  matter  of  the  claims  of  the  patent  sought  to  be 

invalidated  would  have  been  obvious  from  the  subject  matter  of  the  claims  of  the  other 

patent,  and  vice  versa.”    Id.,  220  USPQ  at  487.    See  also  Braat,  937  F.2d  at  593,  19 

USPQ2d at 1292 (explaining two-way test). 

B 

In making its double patenting rejection, the Board concluded that all but one of the 

pending  claims  of  Dembiczak’s  utility  application  would  have  been  merely  an  obvious 

variation of the claims of the earlier-issued design patents--the Dembiczak ‘023 and ‘254 

references--in  light  of  the  Holiday  reference.    The  remaining  claim,  dependent  claim  49, 

was judged obvious in light of the combination of the Dembiczak design patents, Holiday, 

and the Kessler reference. 

Acknowledging that the two-way test was required by Carman, 724 F.2d at 940, 220 

USPQ at 487, the Board concluded that “the design claimed in each of appellants’ design 

patents does not exclude the features pertaining to the construction and color of the bag, 

the use of a plastic material for making the bag, the size or thickness of the bag . . . or the 

use of various types of filling material . . . .  The particular details of the facial indicia would 

have  been  a  matter  of  design  choice  as  evidenced  by  the  Holiday  handbook,”  and  that 

therefore, in view of Holiday, the claims of the design patents were obvious variants of the 

pending utility patent claims. See Dembiczak, slip op. at 11.  We disagree.  In order for a 

design  to  be  unpatentable  because  of  obviousness,  there  must  first  be  a  basic  design 
98-1498 

15 

 

reference in the prior art, the design characteristics of which are “basically the same as the 

claimed  design.”    In  re  Borden, 90 F.3d 1570, 1574, 39 USPQ2d 1524, 1526 (Fed. Cir. 

1996); In re Rosen, 673 F.2d 388, 391, 213 USPQ 347, 350 (CCPA 1982).  The phrase 

“having facial indicia thereon” found in the claims of the pending utility application is not a 

design  reference that is “basically the same as the claimed design.”  Borden, 90 F.3d at 

1574,  39  USPQ2d  at  1526.    In  fact,  it  describes  precious  little  with  respect  to  design 

characteristics.    The  Board’s  suggestion  that the design details were simply “a matter of 

design choice” evinces a misapprehension of the subject matter of design patents.  E.g., 

Carman, 724 F.2d at 939 n.13, 220 USPQ at 486 n.13 (“Utility patents afford protection for 

the  mechanical  structure  and  function  of  an  invention  whereas  design  patent  protection 

concerns the ornamental or aesthetic features of a design.”)  Indeed, we note that the two 

design  patents  at  issue  here--the  Dembiczak  ‘023  and  ‘254  patents--were  considered 

nonobvious over each other, and were even the subject of a restriction requirement. See 35 

U.S.C. § 121 (1994) (“If two or more independent and distinct inventions are claimed in one 

application,  the  Commissioner  may  require  the  application  to  be  restricted  to  one  of  the 

inventions.”);  37  C.F.R.  § 1.142.    The  position  adopted  by  the  Board--that  a  textual 

description  of  facial  indicia  found  in  the  claims  of  the  utility  patent  application  makes 

obvious the specific designs claimed in the (patentably distinct) Dembiczak design patents-

-would presumably render obvious, or even anticipate, all design patents where a face was 

depicted on a bag.  But this, of course, is not the law; the textual description cannot be said 

to be a reference “basically the same as the claimed design,” of the design patents at issue 

here.    Borden,  90  F.3d  at 1574, 39 USPQ2d at 1526 (internal quotation marks omitted).  

The Board’s conclusion of obviousness is incorrect.

Because  we  find  that  the  Board  erred  in  concluding  that  the  design  patents were 

obvious variants of the pending utility claims, we need not address the other prong of the 

two-way double patenting test--whether the pending utility claims are obvious variations of 

the  subject  matter  claimed  in  the  design  patents.    See  Carman,  724  F.2d  at  939,  220 

USPQ  at  487  (both  prongs  of  the  two-way  test  required  for  obviousness-type  double 

patenting).  The double patenting rejections are reversed. 

 

IV 

Because there is no evidence in the record of a suggestion, teaching, or motivation 

to combine the prior art references asserted against the pending claims, the obviousness 

rejections are reversed.  In addition, because the Board misapprehended 

98-1498 

17 

 

the test for obviousness-type double patenting, and because the pending utility claims do 

not render obvious the design patents, the double patenting rejections are also reversed.
