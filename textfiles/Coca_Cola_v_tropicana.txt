ﬂashes before them on their TV sets. This
case involves a 30-second television
commercial with simultaneous audio and
video components. We have no doubt that
the byword of Rome is as valid now as it
was then. And, if seeing something on TV
has a tendency to persuade a viewer to
believe, how much greater is the impact on
a viewer's credulity when he both sees and
hears a message at the same time?
2
In mid-February of 1982 defendant
Tropicana Products, Inc. (Tropicana) began
airing a new television commercial for its
Premium Pack orange juice. The
commercial shows the renowned American
Olympic athlete Bruce Jenner squeezing an orange while saying "It's pure, pasteurized juice as it
comes from the orange," and then shows Jenner pouring the fresh-squeezed juice into a
Tropicana carton while the audio states "It's the only leading brand not made with concentrate
and water."
3
Soon after the advertisement began running, plaintiff Coca-Cola Company (Coke, Coca-Cola),
maker of Minute Maid orange juice, brought suit in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York, 538 F.Supp. 1091, against Tropicana for false advertising in
violation of section 43(a) of the Lanham Act. The statute provides that anyone who uses a false
description or representation in connection with goods placed in commerce "shall be liable to a
civil action by (anyone) ... who believes that he is or is likely to be damaged by the use of ... such
false description or representation." 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a) (1976). Coke claimed the commercial is
false because it incorrectly represents that Premium Pack contains unprocessed, fresh-squeezed
juice when in fact the juice is pasteurized (heated to about 200o Fahrenheit) and sometimes
frozen prior to packaging. The court below denied plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction to
enjoin further broadcast of the advertisement pending the outcome of this litigation. In our view
preliminary injunctive relief is appropriate.

* Scope of Review

A party seeking issuance of a preliminary injunction in this Circuit must always show that it is
likely to suffer possible irreparable harm if the requested relief is not granted. In addition, it must
demonstrate either (1) a likelihood of success on the merits of its case or (2) sufﬁciently serious
questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation and a balance of hardships

tipping decidedly in its favor. Sperry International Trade, Inc. v. Government of Israel, 670 F.2d 8,
11 (2d Cir. 1982); Jackson Dairy, Inc. v. H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc., 596 F.2d 70, 72 (2d Cir. 1979)
(per curiam); Caulﬁeld v. Board of Education, 583 F.2d 605, 610 (2d Cir. 1978); see Mulligan,
Preliminary Injunction in the Second Circuit, 43 Brooklyn L.Rev. 831 (1977).
6
The grant or refusal to grant interlocutory injunctive relief rests in the sound discretion of the
district court judge. Upon appeal, the order granting or denying a preliminary injunction will not be
disturbed unless it results from an abuse of judicial discretion, see Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., 422
U.S. 922, 931-32, 95 S.Ct. 2561, 2567-68, 45 L.Ed.2d 648 (1975), or is contrary to some rule of
equity, Meccano, Ltd. v. John Wanamaker, New York, 253 U.S. 136, 141, 40 S.Ct. 463, 465, 64
L.Ed. 822 (1920).
7
As so often is the case, the rule is easily stated; its precise meaning is more elusive. In reviewing
the action of a trial court, an appellate court is not limited to reversing only when the lower court's
action exceeds any reasonable bounds and to rubber-stamping with the imprimatur of an
afﬁrmance when it does not. Omega Importing Corp. v. Petri-Kine Camera Co., 451 F.2d 1190,
1197 (2d Cir. 1971) (Friendly, C. J.). Congress, in enacting 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1) to give
appellate courts jurisdiction over interlocutory injunctions, surely did not envision that appellate
review should be limited to a choice between the monster Scylla and the abyss of Charybdis.
See Omega Importing, 451 F.2d at 1197; Carroll v. American Federation, 295 F.2d 484, 488 (2d
Cir. 1961). The scope of review over the exercise of a trial court's discretion is broader, lying
between-not relegated to-these two extremes. Thus, as Learned Hand deﬁned it, abuse of
discretion "means no more than that we will not intervene, so long as we think that the (discretion
exercised) is within permissible limits," Barnett v. Equitable Trust Co. of New York, 34 F.2d 916,
920 (2d Cir. 1929), modiﬁed and aff'd sub nom. United States v. Equitable Trust Co. of New York,
283 U.S. 738, 51 S.Ct. 639, 75 L.Ed. 1379 (1930).1

An abuse of discretion may consist of an error
of law, an error of fact, or an error in the
substance or form of the trial court's order. For
example, the trial judge may have an
erroneous view of the law which controls the
pending suit-a statute, standard or line of
cases may be misapprehended-or the judge
may have misapplied the rules governing the
issuance of injunctive relief. The Supreme
Court has viewed an error of law as an abuse
of a trial court's discretion. See United States
v. Corrick, 298 U.S. 435, 438, 56 S.Ct. 829,
830, 80 L.Ed. 1263 (1936). Our Court has
reasoned that where a trial court's denial of an

690 F2d 312 Coca-Cola Company v. Tropicana Products Inc

injunction is based "in substantial measure
upon conclusions of law which can and should
be reviewed because of their basic nature" in
the pending litigation, the order may be
reversed and the case remanded in light of the
appropriate legal principles. Ring v. Spina, 148
F.2d 647, 650 (2d Cir. 1945), cert. denied, 335
U.S. 813, 69 S.Ct. 30, 93 L.Ed. 368 (1948).
9
Beginning decades ago, we have not hesitated
to reverse an order denying a preliminary
injunction where the district court reached an
erroneous conclusion on the facts before it,
see Schey v. Turi, 294 F. 679, 680 (2d Cir.
1923); Palmer v. Superior Manufacturing Co.,
210 F. 452, 453 (2d Cir. 1913); or, as stated now under Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, where the ﬁndings of fact are clearly erroneous, see Unicon Management Corp. v.
Koppers Co., Inc., 366 F.2d 199, 203 (2d Cir. 1966). Further, an abuse of discretion may be
found in the form that the order itself takes, e.g., an injunction may be too broad or too long in
duration, or several injunctions may issue where one will do, see Donovan v. Bierwirth, 680 F.2d
263, 276-77 (2d Cir. 1982).
10
These various errors of law, fact, substance and form, singly or in combination, may affect the
relief granted at the trial level. Upon review, if an error is found which did not actually form the
basis for the determination whether the injunction issued or not, no abuse of discretion will have
occurred because such an error will be deemed harmless. However, when the error, whatever its
nature, is the predicate for the trial court's order, an appellate court must reverse because in such
case the order would plainly result from an improvident exercise of the trial court's discretion.
11
An appellate court discharges its statutory obligation to review when it independently examines
the relevant factors considered by the trial court in reaching its conclusion. See In re Josephson,
218 F.2d 174, 182 (1st Cir. 1954). The appellate court presupposes that the trial judge
understood and applied the applicable law and took into account all the circumstances of the
case. Reversal is warranted only upon a ﬁrm conviction that such presupposition was, in a given
case, misplaced. A trial court's discretion should not be disturbed where a question as to its
validity is perched precariously, as though on a swaying aerial catwalk, subject to doubt and
uncertainty.
12
We believe that the outlined scope of review and the authorities cited sufﬁce for us to reverse in
the instant case where the trial court, by a misapplication of the irreparable injury standard

(discussed at II, infra), concluded that Coca-Cola had failed to show an essential requirement for
injunctive relief. This error of law constitutes an abuse of discretion which mandates reversal. In
addition, we conclude that the trial court's ﬁnding of no facial falseness in defendant's TV
commercial (discussed at III, infra) was an error of fact.
II
Irreparable Injury
13
Perhaps the most difﬁcult element to demonstrate when seeking an injunction against false
advertising is the likelihood that one will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction does not issue. It
is virtually impossible to prove that so much of one's sales will be lost or that one's goodwill will
be damaged as a direct result of a competitor's advertisement. Too many market variables enter
into the advertising-sales equation. Because of these impediments, a Lanham Act plaintiff who
can prove actual lost sales may obtain an injunction even if most of his sales decline is
attributable to factors other than a competitor's false advertising. Johnson & Johnson v. Carter-
Wallace, Inc., 631 F.2d 186, 191 (2d Cir. 1980). In fact, he need not even point to an actual loss
or diversion of sales. Id. at 190-91.
14
The Lanham Act plaintiff must, however, offer something more than a mere subjective belief that
he is likely to be injured as a result of the false advertising, id. at 189; he must submit proof which
provides a reasonable basis for that belief, Vidal Sassoon, Inc. v. Bristol-Myers Co., 661 F.2d
272, 278 (2d Cir. 1981). The likelihood of injury and causation will not be presumed, but must be
demonstrated in some manner. Johnson & Johnson, 631 F.2d at 190.
15
Two recent decisions of this Court have examined the type of proof necessary to satisfy this
requirement. Relying on the fact that the products involved were in head-to-head competition, the
Court in both cases directed the issuance of a preliminary injunction under the Lanham Act. Vidal
Sassoon, 661 F.2d at 227; Johnson & Johnson, 631 F.2d at 189-91.2 In both decisions the Court
reasoned that sales of the plaintiffs' products would probably be harmed if the competing
products' advertising tended to mislead consumers in the manner alleged.3 Market studies were
used as evidence that some consumers were in fact misled by the advertising in issue. Thus, the
market studies supplied the causative link between the advertising and the plaintiffs' potential lost
sales; and thereby indicated a likelihood of injury.
16
Applying the same reasoning to the instant case, if consumers are misled by Tropicana's
commercial, Coca-Cola probably would suffer irreparable injury. Tropicana and Coca-Cola are
the leading national competitors for the chilled (ready-to-serve) orange juice market. If
Tropicana's advertisement misleads consumers into believing that Premium Pack is a more
desirable product because it contains only fresh-squeezed, unprocessed juice, then it is likely

http://openjurist.org/print/252327

Page 5 of 8

690 F2d 312 Coca-Cola Company v. Tropicana Products Inc

5/7/17, 4:08 PM

that Coke will lose a portion of the chilled juice market and thus suffer irreparable injury.
17
Evidence in the record supports the conclusion that consumers are likely to be misled in this
manner. A consumer reaction survey conducted by ASI Market Research, Inc. and a Burke test,
measuring recall of the commercial after it was aired on television, were admitted into evidence,
though neither one was considered by the district court in reference to irreparable injury. The trial
court examined the ASI survey regarding the issue of likelihood of success on the merits, and
found that it contained various ﬂaws which made it difﬁcult to determine for certain whether a
large number of consumers were misled. We do not disagree with those ﬁndings. We note,
moreover, that despite these ﬂaws the district court ruled that there were at least a small number
of clearly deceived ASI interviewees. Our examination of the Burke test results leads to the same
conclusion, i.e., that a not insubstantial number of consumers were clearly misled by the
defendant's ad. Together these tests provide sufﬁcient evidence of a risk of irreparable harm
because they demonstrate that a signiﬁcant number of consumers would be likely to be misled.
The trial court should have considered these studies on the issue of irreparable injury. If it had,
we think that it would surely have concluded, as did this Court in Vidal Sassoon and Johnson &
Johnson, that the commercial will mislead consumers and, as a consequence, shift their
purchases from plaintiff's product to defendant's. Coke, therefore, demonstrated that it is likely to
suffer irreparable injury.
III
Likelihood of Success on the Merits
18
Once the initial requisite showing of irreparable harm has been made, the party seeking a
preliminary injunction must satisfy either of the two alternatives regarding the merits of his case.
We ﬁnd that Coca-Cola satisﬁes the more stringent ﬁrst alternative because it is likely to succeed
on the merits of its false advertising action.
19
Coke is entitled to relief under the Lanham Act if Tropicana has used a false description or
representation in its Jenner commercial. See 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a). When a merchandising
statement or representation is literally or explicitly false, the court may grant relief without
reference to the advertisement's impact on the buying public. American Home Products Corp. v.
Johnson & Johnson, 577 F.2d 160, 165 (2d Cir. 1978); American Brands, Inc. v. R. J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co., 413 F.Supp. 1352, 1356 (S.D.N.Y.1976). When the challenged advertisement is
implicitly rather than explicitly false, its tendency to violate the Lanham Act by misleading,
confusing or deceiving should be tested by public reaction. American Home Products, 577 F.2d
at 165.
20
In viewing defendant's 30-second commercial at oral argument, we concluded that the trial

http://openjurist.org/print/252327

Page 6 of 8

690 F2d 312 Coca-Cola Company v. Tropicana Products Inc

5/7/17, 4:08 PM

court's ﬁnding that this ad was not facially false is an error of fact. Since the trial judge's ﬁnding
on this issue was based solely on the inference it drew from reviewing documentary evidence,
consisting of the commercial, we are in as good a position as it was to draw an appropriate
inference. See San Filippo v. United Brotherhood of Carpenters & Joiners, 525 F.2d 508, 511 (2d
Cir. 1975). We ﬁnd, therefore, that the squeezing-pouring sequence in the Jenner commercial is
false on its face. The visual component of the ad makes an explicit representation that Premium
Pack is produced by squeezing oranges and pouring the freshly-squeezed juice directly into the
carton. This is not a true representation of how the product is prepared. Premium Pack juice is
heated and sometimes frozen prior to packaging. Additionally, the simultaneous audio
component of the ad states that Premium Pack is "pasteurized juice as it comes from the
orange." This statement is blatantly false-pasteurized juice does not come from oranges.
Pasteurization entails heating the juice to approximately 200o Fahrenheit to kill certain natural
enzymes and microorganisms which cause spoilage. Moreover, even if the addition of the word
"pasteurized" somehow made sense and effectively qualiﬁed the visual image, Tropicana's
commercial nevertheless represented that the juice is only squeezed, heated and packaged
when in fact it may actually also be frozen.
21
Hence, Coke is likely to succeed in arguing that Tropicana's ad is false and that it is entitled to
relief under the Lanham Act. The purpose of the Act is to insure truthfulness in advertising and to
eliminate misrepresentations with reference to the inherent quality or characteristic of another's
product, Vidal Sassoon, 661 F.2d at 278. The claim that Tropicana's Premium Pack contains only
fresh-squeezed, unprocessed juice is clearly a misrepresentation as to that product's inherent
quality or characteristic. Since the plaintiff has satisﬁed the ﬁrst preliminary injunction alternative,
we need not decide whether the balance of hardships tips in its favor.
22
Because Tropicana has made a false representation in its advertising and Coke is likely to suffer
irreparable harm as a result, we reverse the district court's denial of plaintiff's application and
remand this case for issuance of a preliminary injunction preventing broadcast of the squeezing-
pouring sequence in the Jenner commercial.

Stated another way, an abuse of a trial court's discretion will be found where an "appellate court
is of (the) opinion that there was commission of an error of law," a judgment "clearly against
logic" or a conclusion "against the reasonable and probable deductions to be drawn from the
facts disclosed upon the hearing." Black's Law Dictionary 10 (5th ed. 1979) (citations omitted)

In Vidal Sassoon it was assumed that two different shampoos competed for the same market, but
in Johnson & Johnson the element of competition had to be proven because the two products,
baby oil and a depilatory containing baby oil, were not obviously competing for the same

In Vidal Sassoon consumers were allegedly misled to believe that Body on Tap shampoo was an
