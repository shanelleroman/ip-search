(http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106A)) aims to protect artists’ “moral rights” related to the proper attribution of
their works, as well as the physical “integrity” of the works themselves.  A survey (http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?

Wall  Street  Journal  observed  (http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703447004575449793518169052?

in 2010, the contours of VARA are continually evolving.  Over the past year, two lawsuits have highlighted some of the ongoing
questions about how VARA protects the rights of artists, particularly when the art at issue has been created on property owned
by someone else.

The 5 Pointz Case

In  a  highly  publicized  opinion,  a  New  York  federal  judge  refused  (http://www.artlawreport.com/ﬁles/2013/11/5Pointz-
decision-B1665419.pdf)  to  issue  an  injunction  to  prevent  the  destruction  of  graﬃti  in  the  so-called  “5  Pointz”  location  in
Queens.  Over the course of many years, 5 Pointz had become what the court called a “repository” of a signiﬁcant “collection
of exterior aerosol art.”  The collection had developed with the informal blessing of one of the property owners, who “was
supportive of creative eﬀorts but wanted somebody responsible to manage it,” and thus had appointed one of the artists to
“curate” the graﬃti at the site and “select who would be permitted to paint on the walls.”  Some of the works were short-lived,
lasting only days or weeks before being replaced with new works, but about two dozen were considered by the curator to be
“permanent,” and not to be painted over.  Over time, the site became a tourist attraction, a popular location for events such as
video and photo shoots, and a “mecca for high-end works by internationally recognized aerosol artists.”  When the buildings at
5 Pointz were scheduled for demolition, a group of artists who had created the “permanent” works sued the buildings’ owners,
seeking to protect their artworks.

Two Recent Cases Highlight The Scope Of Artists' Protections Under VARA - Grossman LLP

5/7/17, 3:43 PM

 

In an opinion issued in late 2013, the court observed that VARA provides a mechanism to protect artworks from destruction,
but only if they are works of “recognized stature.”  The statute does not provide a deﬁnition of that term, and courts have
struggled to develop useful ways to assess whether a work meets that standard.  In the 5 Pointz case, the artists’ testimony
focused on the works’ intrinsic quality, apparently assuming that “if the work had artistic merit it was ipso facto of recognized
stature.”  The defendants and their expert witness, on the other hand, presented a more restrictive view of both “stature” and
“recognition,” and argued that while quality, innovation, and uniqueness were certainly relevant to the issue of “stature,” a court
should also look at “the way these qualities are valued by the public” and the work was “at a level where scholars agree that it
is ‘changing the history of art.’”  On the issue of “recognition,” they urged an inquiry into how works had been examined in
academic publications, articles, and scholarship.

At the preliminary injunction stage, the court declined to rule on the deﬁnition of “recognized stature,” but noted that, although
the overall site of 5 Pointz undoubtedly had stunning “breadth and visual impact” and had become a tourist attraction, VARA’s
protection must focus on particular individual “works” and not the collection as a whole.  Ultimately, the court decided that the
evidence left open the possibility that at least some of the 24 “permanent” works might be of “recognized stature,” but that ﬁnal
resolution should be “left for a fuller exploration of the merits after the case has been properly prepared for trial.”  Thus, for
purposes of a preliminary injunction, the court held there were suﬃciently serious questions going to the merits of the case.

However, the court held that the plaintiﬀs had not made an adequate showing of irreparable harm warranting a preliminary
injunction.  The court noted that in a sense, plaintiﬀs had “created their own hardships,” citing evidence that all the parties
(including the owners, the curator, and other artists) had long held a mutual understanding that the entire arrangement was
ephemeral and the works were transient, meant to last only until the buildings were demolished or put to new use.  Indeed,
many of the works had been created after plans were publicly underway for the buildings to be demolished.  Moreover, the
court said that monetary damages could compensate the artists for the loss of their works, speculating that although the works
were painted for free, “surely the plaintiﬀs would gladly have accepted money from the defendants” to paint them in the ﬁrst
place.  The judge also observed that the “works can live on in other media,” including photographs.

The  5  Pointz  decision  sparked  extensive  commentary,  including  criticism  that  the  court  gave  inadequate  consideration  to
whether  the  collection  as  a  whole  might  be  a  “work”  under  VARA,  that  it  made  an  unwarranted  assumption  that  money
damages and photographs would compensate the artists, and that the judge placed inadequate weight on the loss suﬀered by
the public and the artists when 5 Pointz was destroyed (http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/20/nyregion/5pointz-a-graﬃti-
mecca-in-queens-is-wiped-clean-overnight.html?hpw&rref=nyregion&_r=0).  (On this point, it’s worth noting that while the
buildings  have  not  yet  been  demolished,  the  artworks  have  been  whitewashed  and  obscured  with  paint,  prompting  an
amended complaint by the plaintiﬀs.)

and reputation.”  This case will likely involve interesting disputes over how to value a lost work, particularly a mural that is both
physically and thematically intertwined with its location, with respect to both its market value and the harm the artist might
suﬀer to his reputation.

Second, the artist here may have a stronger argument than the plaintiﬀs in 5 Pointz as to whether the work at issue was of
“recognized stature” as required by the statute.  Henderson has a well established reputation in the art world; his works have
been displayed in several prominent museums, he has lectured at colleges and universities, and art critics and other prominent
artists have hailed the accomplishments and impact of the Los Angeles Fine Art Squad.

Third, the 5 Pointz site gained attention as a repository of hundreds of diﬀerent works, and the court in that case emphasized
that  although  the  overall  5  Pointz  collection  held  cultural  signiﬁcance,  the  “recognized  stature”  analysis  had  to  focus  on
particular individual works.  In Henderson’s case, on the other hand, the dispute will focus on a single work that has been
prominent for many years, and has been spotlighted in sources ranging from the Los Angeles Mural Conservancy website to a
famous photograph of the band the Doors standing in front of it.  Moreover, Henderson’s complaint alleges that his mural could
have been safely removed from the building without mutilation; in other words, there might have been a way to save the mural. 
The parties in the 5 Pointz matter seemed to agree that there was no way for the owner to accomplish the planned demolition
and rebuilding of the property while still preserving the graﬃti art at issue in that case.

projects.  The cases above highlight the particular legal issues involved in applying VARA to works created on property that
belongs to someone other than the artist.  Both cases are ongoing, and may continue to break more new ground in the VARA
arena.
