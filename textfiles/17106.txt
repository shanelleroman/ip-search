HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES
HOUSE REPORT NO. 94–1476

General Scope of Copyright.
The ﬁve fundamental rights that the bill gives to copyright owners—the exclusive rights of reproduction, adaptation, publication, performance, and display—are stated generally
in section 106. These exclusive rights, which comprise the so-called “bundle of rights” that is a copyright, are cumulative and may overlap in some cases. Each of the ﬁve
enumerated rights may be subdivided indeﬁnitely and, as discussed below in connection with section 201, each subdivision of an exclusive right may be owned and enforced
separately.
The approach of the bill is to set forth the copyright owner’s exclusive rights in broad terms in section 106, and then to provide various limitations, qualiﬁcations, or exemptions
in the 12 sections that follow. Thus, everything in section 106 is made “subject to sections 107 through 118”, and must be read in conjunction with those provisions.
The exclusive rights accorded to a copyright owner under section 106 are “to do and to authorize” any of the activities speciﬁed in the ﬁve numbered clauses. Use of the phrase
“to authorize” is intended to avoid any questions as to the liability of contributory infringers. For example, a person who lawfully acquires an authorized copy of a motion picture
would be an infringer if he or she engages in the business of renting it to others for purposes of unauthorized public performance.
Rights of Reproduction, Adaptation, and Publication.
The ﬁrst three clauses of section 106, which cover all rights under a copyright except those of performance and display, extend to every kind of copyrighted work. The exclusive
rights encompassed by these clauses, though closely related, are independent; they can generally be characterized as rights of copying, recording, adaptation, and publishing. A
single act of infringement may violate all of these rights at once, as where a publisher reproduces, adapts, and sells copies of a person’s copyrighted work as part of a publishing
venture. Infringement takes place when any one of the rights is violated: where, for example, a printer reproduces copies without selling them or a retailer sells copies without
having anything to do with their reproduction. The references to “copies or phonorecords,” although in the plural, are intended here and throughout the bill to include the singular
(1 U.S.C. § 1).
Reproduction.—Read together with the relevant deﬁnitions in section 101, the right “to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords” means the right to produce a
material object in which the work is duplicated, transcribed, imitated, or simulated in a ﬁxed form from which it can be “perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated,
either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.” As under the present law, a copyrighted work would be infringed by reproducing it in whole or in any substantial part, and
by duplicating it exactly or by imitation or simulation. Wide departures or variations from the copyrighted work would still be an infringement as long as the author’s “expression”
rather than merely the author’s “ideas” are taken. An exception to this general principle, applicable to the reproduction of copyrighted sound recordings, is speciﬁed in section
114.
“Reproduction” under clause (1) of section 106 is to be distinguished from “display” under clause (5). For a work to be “reproduced,” its ﬁxation in tangible form must be
“suﬃciently permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory duration.” Thus, the showing of
images on a screen or tube would not be a violation of clause (1), although it might come within the scope of clause (5).
Preparation of Derivative Works.—The exclusive right to prepare derivative works, speciﬁed separately in clause (2) of section 106, overlaps the exclusive right of reproduction to
some extent. It is broader than that right, however, in the sense that reproduction requires ﬁxation in copies or phonorecords, whereas the preparation of a derivative work, such
as a ballet, pantomime, or improvised performance, may be an infringement even though nothing is ever ﬁxed in tangible form.
To be an infringement the “derivative work” must be “based upon the copyrighted work,” and the deﬁnition in section 101 refers to “a translation, musical arrangement,
dramatization, ﬁctionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted.” Thus, to constitute a violation of section 106(2), the infringing work must incorporate a portion of the copyrighted work in some form; for example, a
detailed commentary on a work or a programmatic musical composition inspired by a novel would not normally constitute infringements under this clause.
Use in Information Storage and Retrieval Systems.—As section 117 declares explicitly, the bill is not intended to alter the present law with respect to the use of copyrighted
works in computer systems.
Public Distribution.—Clause (3) of section 106 establishes the exclusive right of publication: The right “to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public
by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending.” Under this provision the copyright owner would have the right to control the ﬁrst public distribution of an
authorized copy or phonorecord of his work, whether by sale, gift, loan, or some rental or lease arrangement. Likewise, any unauthorized public distribution of copies or
phonorecords that were unlawfully made would be an infringement. As section 109 makes clear, however, the copyright owner’s rights under section 106(3) cease with respect to
a particular copy or phonorecord once he has parted with ownership of it.
Rights of Public Performance and Display.
Performing Rights and the “For Proﬁt” Limitation.—The right of public performance under section 106(4) extends to “literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works,
pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works and sound recordings” and, unlike the equivalent provisions now in eﬀect, is not limited by any “for proﬁt”
requirement. The approach of the bill, as in many foreign laws, is ﬁrst to state the public performance right in broad terms, and then to provide speciﬁc exemptions for
educational and other nonproﬁt uses.
This approach is more reasonable than the outright exemption of the 1909 statute. The line between commercial and “nonproﬁt” organizations is increasingly diﬃcult to draw.
Many “non-proﬁt” organizations are highly subsidized and capable of paying royalties, and the widespread public exploitation of copyrighted works by public broadcasters and
other noncommercial organizations is likely to grow. In addition to these trends, it is worth noting that performances and displays are continuing to supplant markets for printed
copies and that in the future a broad “not for proﬁt” exemption could not only hurt authors but could dry up their incentive to write.
The exclusive right of public performance is expanded to include not only motion pictures, including works recorded on ﬁlm, video tape, and video disks, but also audiovisual
works such as ﬁlmstrips and sets of slides. This provision of section 106(4), which is consistent with the assimilation of motion pictures to audiovisual works throughout the bill,
is also related to amendments of the deﬁnitions of “display” and “perform” discussed below. The important issue of performing rights in sound recordings is discussed in
connection with section 114.

Right of Public Display.—Clause (5) of section 106 represents the ﬁrst explicit statutory recognition in American copyright law of an exclusive right to show a copyrighted work,
or an image of it, to the public. The existence or extent of this right under the present statute is uncertain and subject to challenge. The bill would give the owners of copyright in
“literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works”, including the individual images of a motion picture or other
audiovisual work, the exclusive right “to display the copyrighted work publicly.”
Deﬁnitions.
Under the deﬁnitions of “perform,” “display,” “publicly,” and “transmit” in section 101, the concepts of public performance and public display cover not only the initial rendition
or showing, but also any further act by which that rendition or showing is transmitted or communicated to the public. Thus, for example: a singer is performing when he or she
sings a song; a broadcasting network is performing when it transmits his or her performance (whether simultaneously or from records); a local broadcaster is performing when it
transmits the network broadcast; a cable television system is performing when it retransmits the broadcast to its subscribers; and any individual is performing whenever he or
she plays a phonorecord embodying the performance or communicates the performance by turning on a receiving set. Although any act by which the initial performance or

she plays a phonorecord embodying the performance or communicates the performance by turning on a receiving set. Although any act by which the initial performance or
display is transmitted, repeated, or made to recur would itself be a “performance” or “display” under the bill, it would not be actionable as an infringement unless it were done
“publicly,” as deﬁned in section 101. Certain other performances and displays, in addition to those that are “private,” are exempted or given qualiﬁed copyright control under
sections 107 through 118.
To “perform” a work, under the deﬁnition in section 101, includes reading a literary work aloud, singing or playing music, dancing a ballet or other choreographic work, and
acting out a dramatic work or pantomime. A performance may be accomplished “either directly or by means of any device or process,” including all kinds of equipment for
reproducing or amplifying sounds or visual images, any sort of transmitting apparatus, any type of electronic retrieval system, and any other techniques and systems not yet in
use or even invented.
The deﬁnition of “perform” in relation to “a motion picture or other audiovisual work” is “to show its images in any sequence or to make the sounds accompanying it audible.”
The showing of portions of a motion picture, ﬁlmstrip, or slide set must therefore be sequential to constitute a “performance” rather than a “display”, but no particular order need
be maintained. The purely aural performance of a motion picture sound track, or of the sound portions of an audiovisual work, would constitute a performance of the “motion
picture or other audiovisual work”; but, where some of the sounds have been reproduced separately on phonorecords, a performance from the phonorecord would not
constitute performance of the motion picture or audiovisual work.
The corresponding deﬁnition of “display” covers any showing of a “copy” of the work, “either directly or by means of a ﬁlm, slide, television image, or any other device or
process.” Since “copies” are deﬁned as including the material object “in which the work is ﬁrst ﬁxed,” the right of public display applies to original works of art as well as to
reproductions of them. With respect to motion pictures and other audiovisual works, it is a “display” (rather than a “performance”) to show their “individual images
nonsequentially.” In addition to the direct showings of a copy of a work, “display” would include the projection of an image on a screen or other surface by any method, the
transmission of an image by electronic or other means, and the showing of an image on a cathode ray tube, or similar viewing apparatus connected with any sort of information
storage and retrieval system.
Under clause (1) of the deﬁnition of “publicly” in section 101, a performance or display is “public” if it takes place “at a place open to the public or at any place where a
substantial number of persons outside of a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances is gathered.” One of the principal purposes of the deﬁnition was to make clear
that, contrary to the decision in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Distributing Corp. v. Wyatt, 21 C.O.Bull. 203 (D.Md.1932), performances in “semipublic” places such as clubs, lodges,
factories, summer camps, and schools are “public performances” subject to copyright control. The term “a family” in this context would include an individual living alone, so that
a gathering conﬁned to the individual’s social acquaintances would normally be regarded as private. Routine meetings of businesses and governmental personnel would be
excluded because they do not represent the gathering of a “substantial number of persons.”
Clause (2) of the deﬁnition of “publicly” in section 101 makes clear that the concepts of public performance and public display include not only performances and displays that
occur initially in a public place, but also acts that transmit or otherwise communicate a performance or display of the work to the public by means of any device or process. The
deﬁnition of “transmit”—to communicate a performance or display “by any device or process whereby images or sound are received beyond the place from which they are
sent”—is broad enough to include all conceivable forms and combinations of wired or wireless communications media, including but by no means limited to radio and television
broadcasting as we know them. Each and every method by which the images or sounds comprising a performance or display are picked up and conveyed is a “transmission,”
and if the transmission reaches the public in my [any] form, the case comes within the scope of clauses (4) or (5) of section 106.
Under the bill, as under the present law, a performance made available by transmission to the public at large is “public” even though the recipients are not gathered in a single
place, and even if there is no proof that any of the potential recipients was operating his receiving apparatus at the time of the transmission. The same principles apply whenever
the potential recipients of the transmission represent a limited segment of the public, such as the occupants of hotel rooms or the subscribers of a cable television service.
Clause (2) of the deﬁnition of “publicly” is applicable “whether the members of the public capable of receiving the performance or display receive it in the same place or in
separate places and at the same time or at diﬀerent times.”
