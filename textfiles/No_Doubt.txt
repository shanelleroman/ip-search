INTRODUCTION

The rock band No Doubt brought suit against the video game publisher Activision Publishing, Inc. (Activision), based on Activision's release of the
Band Hero video game featuring computer-generated images of the members of No Doubt. No Doubt licensed the likenesses of its members for
use in Band Hero, but contends that Activision used them in objectionable ways outside the scope of the parties' licensing agreement. Activision
ﬁled  a  special  motion  to  strike  under  Code  of  Civil  Procedure  section  425.16,  contending  that  No  Doubt  cannot  demonstrate  a  probability  of
prevailing on its claims for violation of the right of publicity (Civ. Code, § 3344 and common law) and unfair competition (Bus. & Prof. Code, §
17200)  because  its  use  of  the  No  Doubt  likenesses  is  protected  by  the  First  Amendment.  Activision  appeals  from  the  trial  court's  denial  of  its
motion.  Applying  the  transformative  use  test  ﬁrst  adopted  in  Comedy III Productions, Inc. v. Gary Saderup, Inc.  (2001)  25  Cal.4th  387  [106
Cal.Rptr.2d 126, 21 P.3d 797], we conclude that the creative elements of the Band Hero video game do not transform the images of No Doubt's
band  members  into  anything  more  than  literal,  fungible  reproductions  of  their  likenesses.  Therefore,  we  reject  Activision's  contention  that  No
Doubt's  right  of  publicity  claim  is  barred  by  the  First  Amendment.  In  addition,  we  disagree  with  Activision's  contention  that  No  Doubt  must
demonstrate  that  Activision  used  the  likenesses  of  the  band  members  in  an  "explicitly  misleading"  way  in  order  to  prevail  on  its  unfair
competition claim. Accordingly, we a"rm the trial court's judgment.

FACTUAL  AND  PROCEDURAL  BACKGROUND

Band Hero Dispute

Defendant Activision is a leading international video game distributor and the creator and owner of the interactive Band Hero video game. Band
Hero is

[192 Cal.App.4th 1023]
[192 Cal.App.4th 1023]
 The game allows players to simulate performing in a rock
a version of Activision's Guitar Hero franchise that has sold over 40 million units.
band in time with popular songs. By choosing from a number of playable characters, known as "avatars," players can "be" a guitarist, a singer, or
a drummer. Some of the available avatars are ﬁctional characters created and designed by Activision while others are digital representations of
real-life rock stars. Players can also design their own unique ﬁctional avatars. Represented by the avatars of their choosing, players "perform" in
various settings, such as venues in Paris and Madrid, a rock show at a shopping mall, and even outer space.

1

In  addition  to  allowing  players  to  perform  over  60  popular  songs,  Band  Hero  permits  players  to  create  their  own  music  and  then  play  their
compositions using an avatar. As with all the Guitar Hero video games, as players advance in the Band Hero game, they can "unlock" characters
and use them to play songs of the players' choosing, including songs the players have composed as well as songs made famous by other artists.

Plainti!  No  Doubt  is  an  internationally  recognized  rock  band  featuring  Gwen  Stefani  as  its  lead  singer.  No  Doubt  entered  into  a  professional
services  and  character  licensing  agreement  (Agreement)  with  Activision  permitting  Activision  to  include  No  Doubt  as  one  of  the  rock  bands
featured in Band Hero.

The pertinent language of the Agreement is as follows: "This Agreement sets out the terms upon which Artist [(No Doubt)] has agreed to grant to
Activision certain rights to utilize Artist's name(s), likeness(es), logo(s), and associated trademark(s) and other related intellectual property rights
(the `Licensed Property') and to provide Activision certain production and marketing services in connection with Activision's `Band Hero' video
game (the `Game')." The Agreement speciﬁcally provides that "Artists grant to Activision the non-exclusive, worldwide right and license to use
the Licensed Property (including Artist's likeness as provided by or approved by Artist) solely in the one (1) Game for all gaming platforms and
formats,  on  the  packaging  for  the  Game,  and  in  advertising,  marketing,  promotional  and  PR  materials  for  the  Game."  In  a  section  entitled
"Approval Rights," the Agreement states that "Artist's likeness as implemented in the Game (the `Character Likeness'), any use of Artist's name
and/or  likeness  other  than  in  a  `billing  block'  fashion  on  the  back  of  the  packaging  for  the  Game,  and  the  b-roll  and  photography  or  other
representation of the Services or of Artist, shall be subject to Artist's prior written approval. [¶] Activision shall submit each of the above (i.e., the
Character Likeness, name uses, and b-roll and photography or other representation) to Artist for review and Artist shall have

[192 Cal.App.4th 1024]
[192 Cal.App.4th 1024]
ten (10) business days to either approve or disapprove. . . . [¶] Activision shall not be required to submit for approval uses of previously approved
assets,  provided  such  uses  fall  within  the  rights  granted  herein  (e.g.,  using  a  previously  approved  Character  Likeness  depiction  in  multiple
advertising materials)."

As part of the Agreement, Activision agreed to license no more than three No Doubt songs for use in Band Hero, subject to No Doubt's approval
over the song choice. (Ultimately, the game included two No Doubt songs.) No Doubt agreed to participate in one day of game production services
"for the purposes of photographing and scanning Artist's likeness, and capturing Artist's motion-capture data."

Pursuant to the Agreement, the members of No Doubt participated in a full-day motion capture photography session at Activision's studios so
that the band members' Band Hero avatars would accurately reﬂect their appearances, movements, and sounds. No Doubt then closely reviewed
the motion capture photography and the details related to the appearance and features of their avatars to ensure the representations would meet
their approval. The end results are avatars that closely match the appearance of each of the No Doubt band members.

Approximately two weeks prior to the release of Band Hero, No Doubt became aware of the "unlocking" feature of the game that would permit

5/7/17, 3:57 PM

Approximately two weeks prior to the release of Band Hero, No Doubt became aware of the "unlocking" feature of the game that would permit
players to use No Doubt's avatars to perform any of the songs included in the game, including songs that No Doubt maintains it never would have
performed. Two of No Doubt's members could be unlocked at the seventh level of the game, and the remaining members could be unlocked at
level  nine.  The  band  also  learned  that  female  lead  singer  Gwen  Stefani's  avatar  could  be  made  to  sing  in  a  male  voice,  and  the  male  band
members'  avatars  could  be  manipulated  to  sing  songs  in  female  voices.  The  individual  band  member  avatars  could  be  made  to  perform  solo,
without their band members, as well as with members of other groups. No Doubt contends that in the numerous communications with No Doubt,
Activision  never  communicated  its  intention  to  permit  such  manipulations  of  the  No  Doubt  avatars.  Rather,  No  Doubt  insists,  Activision
represented that No Doubt's likenesses within Band Hero would be used only in conjunction with the selected No Doubt songs.

When No Doubt complained about the additional exploitation of their likenesses, Activision admitted that it had hired actors to impersonate No
Doubt in order to create the representations of the band members' performances of the additional musical works other than the No Doubt songs
licensed  for  the  game.  No  Doubt  demanded  that  Activision  remove  the  "unlocking"  feature  for  No  Doubt's  avatars,  but  Activision  refused.
Activision

[192 Cal.App.4th 1025]
[192 Cal.App.4th 1025]
contends  that  No  Doubt's  request  came  only  after  the  programming  had  been  ﬁnalized  and  the  manufacturers  had  approved  the  game  for
manufacture.

Procedural History

No  Doubt  ﬁled  a  complaint  against  Activision  in  superior  court,  seeking  injunctive  relief  and  damages  for  Activision's  allegedly  unauthorized
exploitation of No Doubt's name, performances and likenesses. No Doubt alleged six causes of action: (1) fraudulent inducement; (2) violation of
statutory and common law right of publicity; (3) breach of contract; (4) unfair business practices in violation of Business and Professions Code
section 17200; (5) injunctive relief; and (6) rescission.

2

Activision  ﬁled  a  special  motion  to  strike  pursuant  to  Code  of  Civil  Procedure  section  425.16  (section  425.16)  speciﬁcally  with  respect  to  No
Doubt's claims for violation of the right of publicity and unfair competition. The superior court denied the anti-SLAPP (strategic lawsuit against
public participation) motion, holding that Activision failed to meet the required threshold showing that the challenged causes of action arose from
protected activity in furtherance of free speech rights, and that Activision's literal reproductions of the images of the No Doubt members did not
constitute a "transformative" use su"cient to bring them within the protection of the First Amendment. The court found that even if Activision
had satisﬁed its initial burden, No Doubt had demonstrated a probability of prevailing on its claims because it convincingly argued that Activision
had contracted away any First Amendment right to exploit the images of the No Doubt members except as provided by the agreement between the
parties. As such, the court held, Activision had "waived the anti-SLAPP protections."

This timely appeal followed.

DISCUSSION

I.  Anti-SLAPP Motion Procedure

(1) Section 425.16 provides, in pertinent part, that "[a] cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the

[192 Cal.App.4th 1026]
[192 Cal.App.4th 1026]
person's right of petition or free speech under the United States Constitution or the California Constitution in connection with a public issue shall
be subject to a special motion to strike, unless the court determines that the plainti! has established that there is a probability that the plainti!
will prevail on the claim." (§ 425.16, subd. (b)(1).) The purpose of the statute is "to provide a procedural remedy to dispose of lawsuits that are
brought to chill the valid exercise of constitutional rights." (Rusheen v. Cohen (2006) 37 Cal.4th 1048, 1055-1056 [39 Cal.Rptr.3d 516, 128 P.3d
713]; see § 425.16, subd. (a).) The provisions of section 425.16 must be "construed broadly" to e!ectuate the statute's purpose. (§ 425.16, subd.
(a).)

(2) A special motion to strike under section 425.16 entails a two-step process. (Navellier v. Sletten (2002) 29 Cal.4th 82, 88 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 530,
52 P.3d 703] (Navellier).) First, the defendant must make a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action arises from protected activity.
(Rusheen v. Cohen, supra,  37  Cal.4th  at  p.  1056.)  If  the  defendant  makes  this  showing,  the  burden  shifts  to  the  plainti!  to  demonstrate  a
probability of prevailing on the merits of the claim. (Ibid.) The plainti! must state and substantiate a legally su"cient claim: "`[p]ut another way,
the plainti! "must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally su"cient and supported by a su"cient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a
favorable  judgment  if  the  evidence  submitted  by  the  plainti!  is  credited."  [Citations.]'"  (Ibid.)  For  purposes  of  this  inquiry,  "the  trial  court
considers the pleadings and evidentiary submissions of both the plainti! and the defendant [citation] . . . ." (Wilson v. Parker, Covert & Chidester
(2002) 28 Cal.4th 811, 821 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 19, 50 P.3d 733]; see § 425.16 subd. (b)(2).) However, "`the court does not weigh the evidence or make
credibility  determinations.  [Citations.]'"  (Ross v. Kish  (2006)  145  Cal.App.4th  188,  197  [51  Cal.Rptr.3d  484].)  In  addition  to  considering  the
substantive  merits  of  the  plainti!'s  claims,  the  trial  court  must  also  consider  all  available  defenses  to  the  claims,  including  constitutional
defenses. (Traditional Cat Assn., Inc. v. Gilbreath (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 392, 398 [13 Cal.Rptr.3d 353].)

"Only a cause of action that satisﬁes both prongs of the anti-SLAPP statute—i.e., that arises from protected speech or petitioning and lacks even
minimal merit—is a SLAPP, subject to being stricken under the statute." (Navellier, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 89.) We review de novo whether the

minimal merit—is a SLAPP, subject to being stricken under the statute." (Navellier, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 89.) We review de novo whether the
trial  court  should  have  granted  Activision's  special  motion  to  strike,  conducting  an  independent  review  of  the  entire  record.  (Soukup v. Law
O"ces of Herbert Haﬁf (2006) 39 Cal.4th 260, 269, fn. 3 [46 Cal.Rptr.3d 638, 139 P.3d 30].)

II.  No Doubt's Claims Arose from Protected Activity

(3) A defendant satisﬁes its initial burden under section 425.16 by demonstrating that the act underlying the challenged claims ﬁts one of the

[192 Cal.App.4th 1027]
[192 Cal.App.4th 1027]
categories described in section 425.16, subdivision (e). (Navellier, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 88.) One of these categories is "conduct in furtherance of
the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public
interest." (§ 425.16, subd. (e)(4).)

(4) Video games generally are considered "expressive works" subject to First Amendment protections. (Kirby v. Sega of America, Inc. (2006) 144
Cal.App.4th  47,  58  [50  Cal.Rptr.3d  607]  (Kirby);  see Video Software Dealers Ass'n. v. Schwarzenegger  (9th  Cir.  2009)  556  F.3d  950,  958,  cert.
granted sub nom. Schwarzenegger v. Entertainment Merchants Ass'n.  (2010)  ___  U.S.  ___  [176  L.Ed.2d  784,  130  S.Ct.  2398]; Romantics v.
Activision Publishing, Inc.  (E.D.Mich.  2008)  574  F.Supp.2d  758,  765-766  [ﬁnding  that  Activision's  Guitar  Hero  video  game  is  "an  expressive
artistic  work  that  is  entitled  to  First  Amendment  protection"].)  Further,  Activision's  use  of  No  Doubt's  likenesses  in  Band  Hero  is  a  matter  of
public  interest  because  of  the  widespread  fame  No  Doubt  has  achieved;  "`"there  is  a  public  interest  which  attaches  to  people  who,  by  their
accomplishments,  mode  of  living,  professional  standing  or  calling,  create  a  legitimate  and  widespread  attention  to  their  activities  .  .  .  ."
[Citation.]' [Citation.]" (Stewart v. Rolling Stone LLC (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 664, 677-678 [105 Cal.Rptr.3d 98] [magazine's publication of "indie
rock" bands' names was matter of public interest].) Accordingly, the use of No Doubt's likenesses in the Band Hero video game meets the ﬁrst
requirement of the anti-SLAPP statute.

3

(5) No Doubt contends that Activision cannot satisfy the threshold showing under section 425.16 because a contract issue, not Activision's right to
free speech, is at the heart of the parties' dispute. However, in Navellier, our Supreme Court responded to a similar argument from the plainti!s
who were suing based on the defendants' alleged breach of an agreement to release claims. The court held that the plainti!s had set up a "false
dichotomy" between actions that target the performance of contractual obligations and those that target the exercise of free speech and petition
rights, because "conduct alleged to constitute breach of contract may also come within

[192 Cal.App.4th 1028]
[192 Cal.App.4th 1028]
constitutionally protected speech or petitioning." (Navellier, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 92.) Thus, contrary to No Doubt's contention, cases that center
on a contractual dispute are not categorically excluded from the protection of the anti-SLAPP statute.

No Doubt relies on Duncan v. Cohen (N.D.Cal., July 22, 2008, No. C 08-2243 BZ) 2008 WL 2891065, but that case is distinguishable. There, the
plainti! brought numerous claims against the defendants based on the defendants' attempt to make a ﬁlm based on the plainti!'s novel, The
River Why.  The  district  court  denied  the  defendants'  anti-SLAPP  motion,  ﬁnding  that  the  claims  did  not  arise  out  of  protected  activity:  "The
[defendants] are not claiming their rights to use material from The River Why are based on free speech. Rather they contend their rights are based
on a contract. . . . This action centers on copyright and contract claims, not protected activity, and the anti-SLAPP statute does not apply." (Id. at
p. *2.) By contrast, Activision asserts that it has a First Amendment right to exploit the likenesses of No Doubt in Band Hero, separate and apart
from its argument that the license from No Doubt permitted Activision's use.

Having concluded that Activision met its burden to show that the challenged claims arose out of protected activity, we discuss below the second
prong of section 425.16.

III.  No Doubt's Probability of Success on the Merits of the Claims

A.  Right of Publicity Claim

(6) No Doubt has alleged a claim for violation of the right of publicity under Civil Code section 3344 (section 3344) as well as under common law.
Section  3344  provides  in  pertinent  part:  "Any  person  who  knowingly  uses  another's  name,  voice,  signature,  photograph,  or  likeness,  in  any
manner, on or in products, merchandise, or goods, or for purposes of advertising or selling, or soliciting purchases of, products, merchandise,
goods or services, without such person's prior consent . . . shall be liable for any damages sustained by the person or persons injured as a result
thereof." (§ 3344, subd. (a).) The common law claim for misappropriation of the right of publicity is similar, except there is no requirement that
the misappropriation have been done knowingly. (Kirby, supra, 144 Cal.App.4th at p. 55.)

(7) Generally, "plainti!s' burden in opposing an anti-SLAPP motion [is] to substantiate each element of their cause of action, and not merely to
counter defendant's a"rmative defenses." (Balzaga v. Fox News Network, LLC (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 1325, 1337 [93 Cal.Rptr.3d 782].) Because
one of the elements of both the statutory and common law claim for violation of

[192 Cal.App.4th 1029]
[192 Cal.App.4th 1029]
the right of publicity is a lack of prior consent on No Doubt's part, No Doubt's claim would fail if Activision were found to hold a valid license to
use No Doubt's likenesses in the manner in which they are used in Band Hero. (Neal v. Electronic Arts, Inc. (W.D.Mich. 2005) 374 F.Supp.2d 574,
579 [dismissing plainti!'s claims of misappropriation "because the use in question was clearly licensed"].) However, Activision argued below that
for purposes of ruling on the anti-SLAPP motion, the trial court did not need to resolve the issue whether the challenged use of the No Doubt

5/7/17, 3:57 PM

for purposes of ruling on the anti-SLAPP motion, the trial court did not need to resolve the issue whether the challenged use of the No Doubt
avatars  was  outside  the  parties'  license  agreement.  Rather  than  contesting  No  Doubt's  ability  to  support  the  "lack  of  consent"  element  or  any
other substantive element of its right of publicity claim, for purposes of its section 425.16 motion Activision asserted below, and contends here,
only that the First Amendment provides a complete defense to the claim. Thus, we limit our analysis to the strength of that First Amendment
defense.

4

1.  "Transformative Use" Defense

Activision  contends  that  its  use  of  No  Doubt's  likenesses  in  Band  Hero  constitutes  "protected  First  Amendment  activity  involving  an  artistic
work," and thus No Doubt's right of publicity claim is completely barred. As discussed above, "[v]ideo games are expressive works entitled to as
much  First  Amendment  protection  as  the  most  profound  literature."  (Kirby, supra,  144  Cal.App.4th  at  p.  58.)  However,  Activision's  First
Amendment right of free expression is in tension with the rights of No Doubt to control the commercial exploitation of its members' likenesses.

In Comedy III Productions, Inc. v. Gary Saderup, Inc., supra, 25 Cal.4th 387, 391 (Comedy III), our Supreme Court directly confronted this tension.
The court recognized that the right of publicity has a "potential for frustrating

[192 Cal.App.4th 1030]
[192 Cal.App.4th 1030]
the fulﬁllment" of both purposes of the First Amendment: "First, `"to preserve an uninhibited marketplace of ideas" and to repel e!orts to limit
the  "`uninhibited,  robust  and  wide-open'  debate  on  public  issues."'  [Citation.]  Second,  to  foster  a  `fundamental  respect  for  individual
development and self-realization. . . .' [Citations.]" (Comedy III, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp. 396-397.) "Because celebrities take on public meaning,
the  appropriation  of  their  likenesses  may  have  important  uses  in  uninhibited  debate  on  public  issues,  particularly  debates  about  culture  and
values. And because celebrities take on personal meanings to many individuals in the society, the creative appropriation of celebrity images can be
an important avenue of individual expression. . . . [¶] . . . [T]he very importance of celebrities in society means that the right of publicity has the
potential of censoring signiﬁcant expression by suppressing alternative versions of celebrity images that are iconoclastic, irreverent, or otherwise
attempt to redeﬁne the celebrity's meaning." (Id. at p. 397.)

(8)  But,  the  court  concluded,  not  all  expression  with  respect  to  celebrities  is  insulated  by  the  First  Amendment.  "The  right  of  publicity,  like
copyright, protects a form of intellectual property that society deems to have some social utility. `Often considerable money, time and energy are
needed to develop one's prominence in a particular ﬁeld. Years of labor may be required before one's skill, reputation, notoriety or virtues are
su"ciently developed to permit an economic return through some medium of commercial promotion. [Citations.] For some, the investment may
eventually create considerable commercial value in one's identity.' [Citation.]" (Comedy III, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 399.) "[T]he state's interest in
preventing the outright misappropriation of such intellectual property by others is not automatically trumped by the interest in free expression or
dissemination of information . . . ." (Id. at p. 401.)

(9) The court in Comedy III articulated "what is essentially a balancing test between the First Amendment and the right of publicity based on
whether the work in question adds signiﬁcant creative elements so as to be transformed into something more than a mere celebrity likeness or
imitation."  (Comedy III, supra,  25  Cal.4th  at  p.  391.)  Thus,  "[w]hen  artistic  expression  takes  the  form  of  a  literal  depiction  or  imitation  of  a
celebrity for commercial gain, directly trespassing on the right of publicity without adding signiﬁcant expression beyond that trespass, the state
law  interest  in  protecting  the  fruits  of  artistic  labor  outweighs  the  expressive  interests  of  the  imitative  artist."  (Id.  at  p.  405,  fn.  omitted.)  A
celebrity  may  enforce  "the  right  to  monopolize  the  production  of  conventional,  more  or  less  fungible,  images"  of  that  celebrity.  (Ibid.)  On  the
other hand, a work claimed to violate a celebrity's right of publicity is entitled to First Amendment protection where "added creative elements
signiﬁcantly transform the celebrity depiction . . . ." (25 Cal.4th at p. 405, fn. 10.) "Another way of stating the inquiry is whether the celebrity

[192 Cal.App.4th 1031]
[192 Cal.App.4th 1031]
likeness is one of the `raw materials' from which an original work is synthesized, or whether the depiction or imitation of the celebrity is the very
sum and substance of the work in question. We ask, in other words, whether a product containing a celebrity's likeness is so transformed that it
has become primarily the defendant's own expression rather than the celebrity's likeness." (Id. at p. 406.) The inquiry boils down to "whether the
literal and imitative or the creative elements predominate in the work." (Id. at p. 407.)

The court then applied its newly minted "transformative use" test to the facts before it. The plainti! was the owner of the rights to the comedy
act  known  as  The  Three  Stooges.  The  defendant  was  an  artist  who  sold  lithographs  and  T-shirts  bearing  a  likeness  of  The  Three  Stooges
reproduced from a charcoal drawing the artist had created. (Comedy III, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 393.) The owner sued for violation of the right of
publicity under Civil Code section 3344.1, the companion statute to section 3344 that extends the right of publicity to the heirs and assignees of
deceased personalities.

5

The court rejected the artist's contention that the plainti!'s claim was barred by the First Amendment. The court could "discern no signiﬁcant
transformative  or  creative  contribution"  in  the  artist's  literal  reproduction  of  the  likenesses  of  The  Three  Stooges  in  its  charcoal  drawing.
(Comedy III, supra,  25  Cal.4th  at  p.  409.)  The  artist's  "undeniable  skill  is  manifestly  subordinated  to  the  overall  goal  of  creating  literal,
conventional depictions of The Three Stooges so as to exploit their fame." (Ibid.)

The court was careful to note that, in some circumstances, literal reproductions of celebrity portraits may be protected by the First Amendment.
The court used the example of silk screens created by artist Andy Warhol using images of celebrities such as Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor,
and  Elvis  Presley.  "Through  distortion  and  the  careful  manipulation  of  context,  Warhol  was  able  to  convey  a  message  that  went  beyond  the
commercial exploitation of celebrity images and became a form of ironic social comment on the dehumanization of celebrity itself." (Comedy III,
supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp. 408-409.)

The  Supreme  Court  again  addressed  the  balance  between  the  First  Amendment  and  celebrities'  rights  of  publicity  in  Winter,  in  which  the

The  Supreme  Court  again  addressed  the  balance  between  the  First  Amendment  and  celebrities'  rights  of  publicity  in  Winter,  in  which  the
defendant was sued for misappropriation under section 3344 after publishing a series of comic books featuring two villainous half-worm, half-
human characters named the "Autumn brothers." (Winter, supra, 30 Cal.4th at p. 886.) The characters were quite obviously based on the musician
brothers Edgar and Johnny Winter, sharing their same long white hair and albino features. (Ibid.)

[192 Cal.App.4th 1032]
[192 Cal.App.4th 1032]
Applying the "transformative use" test set forth in Comedy III, the court held that the Winter brothers' claim was barred by the First Amendment
as a matter of law. The court found that the comic depictions at issue were "not just conventional depictions of plainti!s but contain signiﬁcant
expressive  content  other  than  plainti!s'  mere  likenesses.  Although  the  ﬁctional  characters  Johnny  and  Edgar  Autumn  are  less-than-subtle
evocations of Johnny and Edgar Winter, the books do not depict plainti!s literally. Instead, plainti!s are merely part of the raw materials from
which  the  comic  books  were  synthesized.  To  the  extent  the  drawings  of  the  Autumn  brothers  resemble  plainti!s  at  all,  they  are  distorted  for
purposes of lampoon, parody, or caricature. And the Autumn brothers are but cartoon characters—half-human and half-worm—in a larger story,
which is itself quite expressive." (Winter, supra, 30 Cal.4th at p. 890.) The comic books featured "fanciful, creative characters, not pictures of the
Winter brothers," in stark contrast to Comedy III, where the artist "essentially sold, and devoted fans bought, pictures of The Three Stooges, not
transformed expressive works by the artist." (Id. at p. 892.)

In Kirby, the Court of Appeal applied the "transformative use" test in a case involving the alleged use of a celebrity's likeness in a video game. The
plainti!, Kierin Kirby, achieved fame as the lead singer of the musical group Deee-Lite which was popular in the early 1990's. Kirby alleged that
video game distributor Sega violated her common law and statutory rights of publicity when it released the video game Space Channel 5 (SC5) that
included as its main character a computer-generated woman named "Ulala" allegedly based on Kirby. (Kirby, supra, 144 Cal.App.4th at p. 51.)

SC5 is set in outer space, in the 25th century, and Ulala is a reporter who is sent to "investigate an invasion of Earth by dance-loving aliens who
shoot earthlings with ray guns, causing them to dance uncontrollably." (Kirby, supra, 144 Cal.App.4th at p. 52.) To advance in the game, players
attempt  to  have  Ulala  match  the  dance  moves  of  various  aliens  and  competitor  reporters.  (Ibid.)  A  Japanese  choreographer  and  dancer  created
Ulala's six main dance moves. (Id. at p. 51.)

Kirby contended that Sega misappropriated her likeness by giving Ulala similar facial features to her own as well as by borrowing her distinctive
look that combines retro and futuristic elements, including red or pink hair, platform shoes, brightly colored formﬁtting clothes, and short skirts.
(Kirby, supra,  144  Cal.App.4th  at  pp.  51,  55-56.)  In  addition,  Ulala's  name  is  a  phonetic  variation  of  "ooh  la  la,"  which  Kirby  alleged  was  her
"signature" lyrical expression included in three of her songs. (Ibid.)

The Court of Appeal concluded that there was a question of fact as to whether Sega had misappropriated Kirby's likeness in creating the character
[192 Cal.App.4th 1033]
[192 Cal.App.4th 1033]
Ulala. (Kirby, supra, 144 Cal.App.4th at pp. 55-56.) However, the court found that even assuming Sega used Kirby's likeness, the First Amendment
provided a complete defense. "[N]otwithstanding certain similarities, Ulala is more than a mere likeness or literal depiction of Kirby," as Ulala's
physique, primary hairstyle and costumes, and dance moves di!ered from Kirby's. (144 Cal.App.4th at p. 59.) "Moreover, the setting for the game
that features Ulala—as a space-age reporter in the 25th century—is unlike any public depiction of Kirby. . . . Taken together, these di!erences
demonstrate  Ulala  is  `transformative,'  and  respondents  added  creative  elements  to  create  a  new  expression"  such  that  the  First  Amendment
barred  Kirby's  claim.  (144  Cal.App.4th  at  p.  59.)  Ulala  was  not  merely  "an  imitative  character  contrived  of  `minor  digital  enhancements  and
manipulations'" (id. at p. 60), and unlike the use of the likenesses of The Three Stooges in Comedy III, any imitation of Kirby's likeness was not
"the  sum  and  substance"  of  Ulala's  character  (id.  at  p.  61).  Rather,  like  the  "Autumn  brothers"  comic  book  characters  in Winter,  "`Ulala  is  a
"fanciful, creative character" who exists in the context of a unique and expressive video game.'" (Ibid.)

With these cases as a backdrop, we now turn to Activision's use of No Doubt's likenesses in Band Hero.

2.  Use of No Doubt's Likenesses in Band Hero Is Not "Transformative"

Activision does not dispute that the avatars of No Doubt are computer-generated recreations of the real band members, painstakingly designed to
mimic  their  likenesses.  Indeed,  as  part  of  the  licensing  agreement  between  Activision  and  No  Doubt,  No  Doubt  posed  for  motion-capture
photography to enable Activision to reproduce their likenesses, movements, and sounds with precision. Activision intentionally used these literal
reproductions so that players could choose to "be" the No Doubt rock stars. The game does not permit players to alter the No Doubt avatars in any
respect;  they  remain  at  all  times  immutable  images  of  the  real  celebrity  musicians,  in  stark  contrast  to  the  "fanciful,  creative  characters"  in
Winter and Kirby. (Winter, supra, 30 Cal.4th at p. 892; see Kirby, supra, 144 Cal.App.4th at p. 61.)

(10) No Doubt asserts that such realistic depictions categorically disqualify their Band Hero avatars from First Amendment protection. However, as
Comedy III held, even literal reproductions of celebrities can be "transformed" into expressive works based on the context into which the celebrity
image  is  placed.  (Comedy III, supra,  25  Cal.4th  at  p.  409  [noting,  for  instance,  the  Warhol  silk  screens  featuring  celebrity  portraits,  through
"careful manipulation of context," convey an ironic message about the "dehumanization of celebrity" through reproductions of celebrity images];

Masters  Tournament  and  conveyed  a  message  about  the  signiﬁcance  of  Woods's  achievement  through  images  suggesting  that  Woods  would
eventually join the ranks of the world's best golfers].) Thus, when the context into which a literal celebrity depiction is placed creates "`something
new,  with  a  further  purpose  or  di!erent  character,  altering  the  ﬁrst  [likeness]  with  new  expression,  meaning,  or  message,'"  the  depiction  is
protected by the First Amendment. (Comedy III, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 404; see also id. at p. 405, fn. 10 [work is insulated by 1st Amend. only
where "added creative elements signiﬁcantly transform the celebrity depiction . . ." (italics added)].)

Nonetheless, although context may create protected expression in the use of a celebrity's literal likeness, the context in which Activision uses the
literal likenesses of No Doubt's members does not qualify the use of the likenesses for First Amendment protection. Activision contends that as in
Kirby,  where  Sega  used  Kirby's  likeness  in  a  unique  and  expressive  video  game,  Activision's  use  of  No  Doubt's  likenesses  in  Band  Hero  is
transformative because the video game shows the No Doubt avatars "surrounded by unique, creative elements, including in fanciful venues such
as outer space . . . and performing songs that No Doubt avowedly would never perform in real life." Indeed, according to Activision, No Doubt's
objection  that  the  band  can  be  made  to  perform  songs  it  would  never  perform  demonstrates  that  the  use  of  the  No  Doubt  avatars  is
transformative.

However,  that  the  members  of  No  Doubt  object  to  being  shown  performing  certain  songs  is  irrelevant  to  whether  that  element  of  Band  Hero
combined with others transforms the literal depictions of No Doubt's members into expression that is more Activision's than pure mimicry. In
that inquiry, it is the di!erences between Kirby and the instant case, not the similarities, which are determinative. In Kirby, the pop singer was
portrayed as an entirely new character—the space-age news reporter Ulala. In Band Hero, by contrast, no matter what else occurs in the game
during the depiction of the No Doubt avatars, the avatars perform rock songs, the same activity by which the band achieved and maintains its
fame. Moreover, the avatars perform those songs as literal recreations of the band members. That the avatars can be manipulated to perform at
fanciful venues including outer space or to sing songs the real band would object to singing, or that the avatars appear in the context of a video
game  that  contains  many  other  creative  elements,  does  not  transform  the  avatars  into  anything  other  than  exact  depictions  of  No  Doubt's
members doing exactly what they do as celebrities. (Hilton v. Hallmark Cards (9th Cir.

[192 Cal.App.4th 1035]
[192 Cal.App.4th 1035]
2010) 599 F.3d 894, 911 (Hilton) [Hallmark card featuring Paris Hilton's head on a cartoon waitress's body was not a "transformative use" as in
Kirby because, despite some di!erences, the "basic setting" was the same as an episode of Hilton's television show in which she is depicted as

"born to privilege, working as a waitress"];
 Keller v. Elec. Arts, Inc. (N.D.Cal., Feb. 8, 2010, No. C 09-1967 CW) 2010 U.S.Dist. Lexis 10719, app.
pending [NCAA Football video game literally depicting college football player held not "transformative" where player was represented as exactly
what  he  was—the  starting  quarterback  for  Arizona  State  University—and  game's  setting—a  football  ﬁeld—was  "identical  to  where  the  public
found [plainti!] during his collegiate career"].)

Moreover, Activision's use of lifelike depictions of No Doubt performing songs is motivated by the commercial interest in using the band's fame to
market Band Hero, because it encourages the band's sizeable fan base to purchase the game so as to perform as, or alongside, the members of No
Doubt. Thus, insofar as the depiction of No Doubt is concerned, the graphics and other background content of the game are secondary, and the
expressive elements of the game remain "manifestly subordinated to the overall goal of creating a conventional portrait of [No Doubt] so as to
commercially exploit [its] fame." (Comedy III, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 408.) In other words, nothing in the creative elements of Band Hero elevates
the depictions of No Doubt to something more than "conventional, more or less fungible, images" of its members that No Doubt should have the
right to control and exploit. (Comedy III, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 405.) Thus, the trial court did not err in denying Activision's motion to strike the
right of publicity claim based on Activision's assertion of a First Amendment defense.

B.  Unfair Competition Claim

(11)  To  state  a  claim  for  unfair  competition  under  Business  and  Professions  Code  section  17200  (section  17200),  a  plainti!  must  show  that
"`members of the public are likely to be deceived'" by a particular business practice. (Bank of the West v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254,
1267 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545]; see In re Tobacco II Cases (2009) 46 Cal.4th 298, 324 [93 Cal.Rptr.3d 559, 207 P.3d 20] [California's unfair
competition  law  protects  the  public  from  fraud,  deceit  and  unlawful  conduct].)  No  Doubt  alleges  that  Activision  violated  section  17200  by
deceiving the public into believing that No Doubt authorized the use of its name and likeness for the unlocking feature of Band Hero and that "No
Doubt approves and endorses the appearance of its members individually performing songs that are wholly inappropriate and out of character for
No Doubt."

Activision makes the novel argument that we should construe section 17200 to require No Doubt to prove that Activision's challenged use of No
Doubt's avatars "explicitly misleads the public," i.e., that Activision overtly represented that No Doubt approved the unlocking feature as well as
all  the  songs  their  avatars  can  be  made  to  sing.  Activision  derives  this  heightened  standard  from  federal  cases  construing  the  Lanham  Act  (15
U.S.C. § 1051 et seq.) in

[192 Cal.App.4th 1037]
[192 Cal.App.4th 1037]
the context of alleged trademark infringement by artistic works deserving of First Amendment protection. For the reasons discussed below, we
hold that No Doubt is not obligated to prove that the use of its avatars in Band Hero is "explicitly misleading" in order to prevail on its section
17200 claim.

(12) To provide context for Activision's argument, we begin with a brief discussion of how federal courts have applied the Lanham Act to artistic
works alleged to infringe trademarks. The purpose of the Lanham Act, 15 United States Code section 1051 et seq., "is to `avoid confusion in the
marketplace'  by  allowing  a  trademark  owner  to  `prevent[]  others  from  duping  consumers  into  buying  a  product  they  mistakenly  believe  is
sponsored by the trademark owner.' [Citation.] Trademark law aims to protect trademark owners from a false perception that they are associated

sponsored by the trademark owner.' [Citation.] Trademark law aims to protect trademark owners from a false perception that they are associated
with or endorse a product. [Citation.] Generally, to assess whether a defendant has infringed on a plainti!'s trademark, we apply a `likelihood of
confusion' test that asks whether use of the plainti!'s trademark by the defendant is `likely to cause confusion or to cause mistake, or to deceive
as to the a"liation, connection, or association' of the two products. [Citation.]" (Mattel, Inc. v. Walking Mountain Productions (9th Cir. 2003) 353
F.3d 792, 806-807; see Franklin Mint Co. v. Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLP (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 313, 342 [109 Cal.Rptr.3d 143].)

When the challenged use of a trademark appears in an artistic work that implicates First Amendment protections, some courts have concluded
that the standard "likelihood of confusion" test under the Lanham Act is inadequate to address First Amendment concerns. The seminal case is
Rogers v. Grimaldi (2d Cir. 1989) 875 F.2d 994 (Rogers), in which the Second Circuit developed an alternative to the "likelihood of confusion" test
to be used for titles of artistic works that borrow names protected by trademark.

In Rogers, the actress Ginger Rogers sued under the Lanham Act, contending that the title of a movie, Ginger and Fred (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
1986), which told the story of two ﬁctional Italian cabaret performers who imitated Rogers and Fred Astaire in their cabaret act, created the false
impression that Rogers was associated with the ﬁlm or that the ﬁlm was about her. The trial court held that the Lanham Act did not apply to any
movie title "`within the realm of artistic expression.'" (Rogers, supra, 875 F.2d at p. 997.) The Second Circuit found that while the trial court's
approach correctly took into account First Amendment concerns, it "unduly narrows the scope of the [Lanham] Act," because it would insulate
from liability titles that were truly deceptive about their source or sponsorship. (875 F.2d at p. 997.)

The Second Circuit struck a di!erent balance, holding that "in general the Act should be construed to apply to artistic works only where the public
[192 Cal.App.4th 1038]
[192 Cal.App.4th 1038]
interest  in  avoiding  consumer  confusion  outweighs  the  public  interest  in  free  expression.  In  the  context  of  allegedly  misleading  titles  using  a
celebrity's name, that balance will normally not support application of the Act unless the title has no artistic relevance to the underlying work
whatsoever, or, if it has some artistic relevance, unless the title explicitly misleads as to the source or the content of the work." (Rogers, supra,
875 F.2d at p. 999.) Under this test, for instance, a defendant is liable under the Lanham Act if he uses a celebrity name in a book title when the
name bears no relation at all to the content of the book, thereby confusing the public into thinking otherwise—a situation in which the use of the
name has no artistic relevance to the work. (875 F.2d at p. 999.) And even if the celebrity name does bear some relevance to the content of the
book (that is, has some artistic relevance to the work), the title cannot explicitly deceive the public as to its source or content, such as by claiming
that it is an "`authorized biography'" of the celebrity when it is not (an explicit misrepresentation as to the source or content). (Ibid.)

Applying this test in Rogers, the Second Circuit concluded that the Lanham Act claim failed. The title, Ginger and Fred, had genuine relevance to
the ﬁlm's story—the characters in the ﬁlm imitated Rogers and Astaire in the characters' cabaret act. Further, nothing about the ﬁlm title overtly
suggested that Rogers was involved with or was the subject of the ﬁlm, and the risk that some members of the public would reach either of these
erroneous conclusions was outweighed by the interests in the ﬁlm's artistic expression, which contrasted the "elegance and class" Rogers and
Astaire embodied with the "gaudiness and banality of contemporary television." (Rogers, supra, 875 F.2d at p. 1001.)

In Mattel, Inc. v. MCA Records, Inc. (9th Cir. 2002) 296 F.3d 894 (MCA), the Ninth Circuit adopted the Rogers test and found that it barred the
Barbie trademark holder's Lanham Act claim over a song entitled Barbie Girl, an expressive work poking fun at the values Barbie represented. (Id.
at p. 902.) The Ninth Circuit, along with several other federal circuit courts, has since extended the Rogers test beyond titles of artistic works to
artistic works in general. (See, e.g., E.S.S. Entertainment 2000 v. Rock Star Videos (9th Cir. 2008) 547 F.3d 1095, 1099 (E.S.S.) [ﬁnding Rogers test
could be applied to the use of a trademark in the body of the work]; ETW, supra, 332 F.3d at p. 928, fn. 11 [holding the rule of Rogers is generally
applicable to all Lanham Act cases involving artistic works where the defendant "has articulated a colorable claim" that the work is protected by
the 1st Amend.]; Cli!s Notes v. Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group (2d Cir. 1989) 886 F.2d 490, 495.)

Activision  contends  that  we  should  construe  section  17200  to  incorporate  the Rogers  standard  as  an  element  of  No  Doubt's  unfair  competition
claim, because the claim is "`substantially congruent'" to a trademark infringement

[192 Cal.App.4th 1039]
[192 Cal.App.4th 1039]
claim under the Lanham Act, given that for both "the `"ultimate test"' is `"whether the public is likely to be deceived or confused by the similarity
of the marks."' [Citations.]" (Academy of Motion Picture Arts v. Creative House (9th Cir. 1991) 944 F.2d 1446, 1457; see also MCA, supra, 296 F.3d
at p. 902 [same likelihood of confusion test applies to Lanham Act claim and state law claim for unfair competition].) In other words, just as a
defendant's  artistic  expression  that  infringes  upon  a  trademark  generally  will  only  be  actionable  under  the  Lanham  Act  if  it  is  "explicitly
misleading," Activision contends its use of No Doubt's likenesses should not be actionable under section 17200 unless that use was "explicitly
misleading."

8

Even  if  the Rogers  "explicitly  misleading"  test  might  be  applied  to  some  section  17200  claims  involving  the  unauthorized  use  of  a  celebrity's
likeness  (a  conclusion  we  do  not  reach),
  the  test  does  not  apply  to  No  Doubt's  section  17200  claim.  Activision  overlooks  the  overarching
conclusion  in Rogers  that  the  public  interest  in  avoiding  consumer  confusion  must  be  balanced  against  the  public  interest  in  free  expression.
(Rogers, supra,  875  F.2d  at  p.  999.)  The  "explicitly  misleading"  standard  comes  into  play  only  after  a  determination  has  been  made  that  a
challenged  use  of  a  trademark  is  worthy  of  heightened  First  Amendment  protection.  (ETW, supra,  332  F.3d  at  p.  926  [Rogers  test  applies  to
Lanham  Act  "false  endorsement"  claim  only  where  the  defendant  "has  articulated  a  colorable  claim  that  the  use  of  a  celebrity's  identity  is
protected  by  the  First  Amendment"]; Facenda v. N.F.L. Films, Inc.  (3d  Cir.  2008)  542  F.3d  1007,  1015  [before  considering  whether Rogers  test
applies,

[192 Cal.App.4th 1040]
[192 Cal.App.4th 1040]

court must determine whether allegedly infringing work is a work of artistic expression entitled to heightened 1st Amend. protection].)

(13) Here, we have already concluded that Activision's use of No Doubt's avatars is not "transformative" because the avatars are simply precise
computer-generated  reproductions  of  the  band  members  that  do  not  meld  with  the  other  elements  of  Band  Hero  to  become,  in  essence,

computer-generated  reproductions  of  the  band  members  that  do  not  meld  with  the  other  elements  of  Band  Hero  to  become,  in  essence,
Activision's  own  artistic  expression.  In  the  case  of  such  a  "nontransformative"  use  of  celebrity  likenesses,  "the  public  interest  in  avoiding
consumer confusion outweighs the public interest in free expression" (Rogers, supra, 875 F.2d at p. 999), and it would make little sense to require
No Doubt to make the almost impossible showing that Activision's nontransformative use of the No Doubt avatars was "explicitly misleading." Of
course,  to  prevail  on  its  section  17200  claim,  No  Doubt  will  still  have  to  demonstrate  that  members  of  the  public  are  likely  to  be  deceived  by
Activision's use of the likenesses.

In sum, the trial court did not err in denying Activision's motion to strike No Doubt's section 17200 claim based on Activision's contention that its
challenged use of the No Doubt avatars was not explicitly misleading.

DISPOSITION

The judgment is a"rmed. No Doubt shall recover its costs and attorneys fees on appeal.

Suzukawa, J., concurred.

EPSTEIN, P. J., Concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.—

The  majority  opinion  in  this  case  a"rms  the  decision  of  the  trial  court,  which  denied  Activision's  special  motion  to  strike  under  Code  of  Civil
Procedure  section  425.16  (the  anti-SLAPP  (strategic  lawsuit  against  public  participation)  law).  I  agree  with  that  result,  and  concur  in  the
judgment. In its analysis, the majority decides, ﬁrst, that appellant's claims arose from First Amendment-protected activity, and hence satisfy the
ﬁrst prong of the test for motions under the anti-SLAPP statute. I agree with the majority's reasoning and conclusion on that issue. (See Navellier
v. Sletten (2002) 29 Cal.4th 82, 88 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 530, 52 P.3d 703].)

The majority then discusses the second prong of the test: whether No Doubt made a prima facie showing of probability that it would prevail on the
merits of its lawsuit. It does so on a First Amendment basis, ﬁnding that the challenge to Activision Publishing, Inc.'s use of No Doubt characters
and likenesses in its video game does not satisfy the "transformative use" doctrine of Comedy III Productions, Inc. v. Gary Saderup, Inc. (2001) 25
Cal.4th 387,

[192 Cal.App.4th 1041]
[192 Cal.App.4th 1041]
391 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 126, 21 P.3d 797] (Comedy III). Because of that conclusion, it does not reach No Doubt's claim that Activision had no such
right in light of its contract with No Doubt. (Maj. opn., ante, at pp. 1035-1036, fn. 7.)

I  would  decide  the  case  the  other  way  around:  I  would  conclude  that,  under  the  facts  of  this  case,  the  contract  between  the  parties  precludes
Activision's  First  Amendment  claim,  making  it  unnecessary  to  reach  the  "transformative  use"  issue.  (See Teachers' Retirement Bd. v. Genest
(2007)  154  Cal.App.4th  1012,  1043  [65  Cal.Rptr.3d  326]  [a  fundamental  principle  of  constitutional  adjudication  is  that  court  will  not  decide
constitutional  questions  unless  absolutely  required  to  do  so  in  order  to  dispose  of  matter  before  it],  and  authority  cited.)  That  said,  I  do  not
dispute the majority's reasoning on that issue.

The majority opinion fairly and accurately sets out the factual and procedural history of the case, as well as the principal authorities for reviewing
trial court decisions under the anti-SLAPP law. There is no need to reprise that discussion here.

What is central in this case (and not involved in Comedy III and other cases cited) is that Activision's entire right to formulate avatars taken from
No Doubt performers is based on its license agreement with No Doubt. In that document (written on Activision letterhead) No Doubt licensed the
use by Activision of "certain rights" as to the No Doubt name, likenesses, logos and associated trademarks, and related intellectual property (the
"Licensed  Property")  in  a  Band  Hero  video  game.  No  Doubt  (styled  "Artist"  in  the  agreement)  agreed  to  participate  in  a  performance  session
which  Activision  could  photograph  and  scan  for  the  creation  of  avatars  based  on  the  No  Doubt  characters  and  performance.  The  agreement
subordinated Activision's right to use avatars based on No Doubt "Licensed Property" upon approval by No Doubt "over the songs to be used,"
which approval was not to be unreasonably withheld. The "Approval Rights" section of the contract reserved to No Doubt (with exceptions not
germane here) the right of prior approval of any use of the character likenesses (and set out a system for obtaining such approval, including a
provision that a failure by No Doubt to approve or disapprove after speciﬁed notiﬁcation may be deemed approval), and of "the songs to be used,"
which approval was not to be "unreasonably withheld."

In  sum,  this  was  a  commercial  agreement  that  granted  a  limited  license  to  Activision  for  use  of  No  Doubt's  character  likenesses  in  songs,  all
subject  to  No  Doubt's  prior  approval.  Activision's  exploitation  of  the  intellectual  property  was  subject  to  the  terms  of  the  agreement.  Having
agreed to its terms, Activision cannot be heard to claim that its use of the property in ways expressly prohibited by the agreement is protected by
the First Amendment.

[192 Cal.App.4th 1042]
[192 Cal.App.4th 1042]
Activision  was  not  acting  as  a  lampooner  or  commentator,  nor  in  any  context  other  than  as  a  licensee  of  No  Doubt's  intellectual  property.  It
proceeded to include in its Band Hero game No Doubt intellectual property, avatars, and sound depictions in a manner which No Doubt did not
approve, had no opportunity to approve, and would not have approved. Since its rights to use this property in a video game were governed by the
license  agreement,  Activision  is  precluded  from  relying  on  the  "transformative  use"  doctrine  to  defend  this  breach  of  the  agreement.  Stated
another way, the license agreement is antithetical to a First Amendment claim that it had a right to exploit No Doubt's intellectual property in
breach of the license agreement.

I would a"rm the trial court's ruling on this basis.

I would a"rm the trial court's ruling on this basis.

FootNotes

1. The parties submitted DVD's depicting the game, which we have reviewed.

2. Activision initially removed the case to federal court, contending that No Doubt's claims were preempted by the federal Digital Millenium
Copyright Act (Pub.L. No. 105-304 (Oct. 28, 1998) 112 Stat. 2860). Activision then answered the complaint and ﬁled cross-claims for breach of
contract and unjust enrichment based on No Doubt's alleged failure to provide marketing and promotional services as the band had contracted to
do. The federal district court remanded the case to state court, ﬁnding that No Doubt's claims as alleged were not preempted by the copyright act.
(No Doubt v. Activision Publishing, Inc. (C.D.Cal. 2010) 702 F.Supp.2d 1139.)

3. As Activision observes, in concluding that the challenged claims did not satisfy the ﬁrst prong, the trial court erred in focusing on whether the
First Amendment provided a complete bar to No Doubt's claim. "`The Legislature did not intend that in order to invoke the special motion to
strike the defendant must ﬁrst establish her actions are constitutionally protected under the First Amendment as a matter of law. . . .' [Citations.]"
(Navellier, supra, 29 Cal.4th at pp. 94-95.) "`Instead, under the statutory scheme, a court must generally presume the validity of the claimed
constitutional right in the ﬁrst step of the anti-SLAPP analysis, and then permit the parties to address the issue in the second step of the analysis,
if necessary. [Citation.] Otherwise, the second step would become superﬂuous in almost every case, resulting in an improper shifting of the
burdens.' [Citations.]" (City of Los Angeles v. Animal Defense League (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 606, 621 [37 Cal.Rptr.3d 632].)

4. We have previously held that "`[a]lthough section 425.16 places on the plainti! the burden of substantiating its claims, a defendant that
advances an a"rmative defense to such claims properly bears the burden of proof on the defense. [Citation.]' [Citation.]" (Premier Medical
Management Systems, Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 464, 477 [39 Cal.Rptr.3d 43]; see also Seltzer v. Barnes (2010)
182 Cal.App.4th 953, 969 [106 Cal.Rptr.3d 290].) Other courts have suggested, however, that the burden remains on the plainti! to overcome the
a"rmative defenses by demonstrating that the "`"defenses are not applicable to the case as a matter of law or by a prima facie showing of facts
which, if accepted by the trier of fact, would negate such defenses."'" (Birkner v. Lam (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 275, 285 [67 Cal.Rptr.3d 190],
quoting Paul for Council v. Hanyecz (2001) 85 Cal.App.4th 1356, 1367 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 864], disapproved on another ground in Equilon Enterprises
v. Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 53, 68, fn. 5 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 507, 52 P.3d 685].) It makes no di!erence here which party bears the
burden on the a"rmative defenses, because, as discussed further below, we conclude that Activision's First Amendment defense fails as a matter
of law. (See Winter v. DC Comics (2003) 30 Cal.4th 881, 888 [134 Cal.Rptr.2d 634, 69 P.3d 473] (Winter) [holding that courts can often resolve as a
matter of law whether a claim is barred by the 1st Amend.].)

5. The test developed in Comedy III "applies equally" to claims under section 3344. (Winter, supra, 30 Cal.4th at p. 888.)

6. An earlier Ninth Circuit decision, Ho!man v. Capital Cities/ABC, Inc. (9th Cir. 2001) 255 F.3d 1180, arguably reached a di!erent conclusion on
facts somewhat similar to those in Hilton. In Ho!man, the court found that the First Amendment barred Dustin Ho!man's claim that Los Angeles
Magazine (LAM) had violated his right of publicity when it published an article that included a photographic image of the head of Ho!man in his
"Tootsie" character superimposed on the body of a cartoon male who was wearing an evening gown and high heels. (Ho!man, supra, 255 F.3d at
p. 1183.) The court only brieﬂy addressed the transformative use defense, ﬁnding that "[e]ven if we were to consider LAM an `artist' and the
altered `Tootsie' photograph `artistic expression' subject to the Comedy III decision, there is no question that LAM's publication of the `Tootsie'
photograph contained `signiﬁcant transformative elements'" because "Ho!man's body was eliminated and a new, di!erently clothed body was
substituted in its place." (Id. at p. 1184, fn. 2.) In Hilton, the Ninth Circuit noted that Ho!man had not addressed the transformative use defense
in great depth because the Supreme Court decided Comedy III only after oral argument in the Ho!man case had taken place. Thus, Hilton
concluded that Ho!man was not controlling Ninth Circuit authority on the issue of the transformative use defense. (Hilton, supra, 599 F.3d at p.
912, fn. 15.) We similarly do not ﬁnd Ho!man's brief discussion or application of the transformative use defense compelling.

7. Because we hold that Activision's use of No Doubt's likenesses is not protected by the First Amendment, we need not consider No Doubt's
argument that Activision waived its First Amendment rights by entering a licensing agreement that allegedly limits its rights to use the
likenesses. The concurring opinion would a"rm the trial court's judgment on the basis of the licensing agreement, interpreting it as a waiver by
Activision of any First Amendment rights it may have had. The concurrence suggests that we should not reach the question of the validity of
Activision's First Amendment defense because of the principle of judicial restraint that counsels against unnecessarily addressing constitutional
questions. (Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control v. Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Bd. (2006) 40 Cal.4th 1, 17, fn. 13 [50 Cal.Rptr.3d 585,
145 P.3d 462].) This principle of constitutional adjudication is most often relied upon as the justiﬁcation for refraining from deciding the
constitutionality of a statute when the matter can be decided on statutory or other grounds. (E.g., Thompson v. Department of Corrections (2001)
25 Cal.4th 117, 128-129 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 46, 18 P.3d 1198] [where plainti!'s complaint asserted both statutory and constitutional grounds for
invalidating prison regulation, court would address the statutory issue ﬁrst]; Santa Clara County Local Transportation Authority v. Guardino
(1995) 11 Cal.4th 220, 230-231 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 207, 902 P.2d 225] [where tax was challenged under state statute and state Constitution, it was
proper to begin with statutory challenge].) Here, however, we are not being called upon to pass on the constitutionality of legislation, but rather
to consider a First Amendment defense to a right of publicity claim in the context of a suit between private citizens. Moreover, while the principle
of restraint in deciding constitutional issues has broader application, we are also mindful that courts must "`"`closely scrutinize waivers of
constitutional rights'"" and "`"`"indulge every reasonable presumption against a waiver"'"'" of First Amendment rights, which "`"may only be
made by a `clear and compelling' relinquishment of them."'" (Sanchez v. County of San Bernardino (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 516, 528 [98

made by a `clear and compelling' relinquishment of them."'" (Sanchez v. County of San Bernardino (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 516, 528 [98
Cal.Rptr.3d 96]; see Ferlauto v. Hamsher (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 1394, 1400 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 843].) Given these circumstances, we believe the best
path is to decide this case based upon what we view as a relatively straightforward application of the "transformative use" doctrine, and not on an
interpretation of the licensing agreement, an issue on which we express no opinion.

8. Although the "explicitly misleading" requirement of the Rogers test makes obvious sense when the title of an artistic work is at issue, and thus
conventional "speech" is involved, we question whether it should apply when the actionable wrong is the misappropriation of a celebrity's
likeness in a video game. In any event, no California court has interpreted section 17200 to require a showing that the defendant's actionable
conduct was "explicitly misleading" when the First Amendment is implicated. In arguing that such a showing is required under California law,
Activision relies solely on E.S.S., in which the Ninth Circuit concluded that the First Amendment defense based on the Rogers test "applies equally
to ESS's state law claims," which necessarily included its section 17200 claim. (E.S.S., supra, 547 F.3d at p. 1101.) Of course, we are not bound by
the Ninth Circuit's interpretation that the Rogers test applies to section 17200 claims. (Myers Building Industries, Ltd. v. Interface Technology,
Inc. (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 949, 971, fn. 19 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 242].) Moreover, E.S.S. contains no analysis supporting its conclusion that the Rogers
test should apply to section 17200 claims, because the plainti! conceded that the Rogers test applied, and the Ninth Circuit thus had no cause to
discuss the issue. (E.S.S., supra, 547 F.3d at pp. 1099-1100.) Further, E.S.S. did not concern the literal reproduction of a celebrity's likeness, but
rather alleged trademark and trade dress infringement by a virtual depiction of a strip club that shared certain characteristics with a real strip
club. (Id. at pp. 1097-1098.)

We note that in Kirby, in considering a section 17200 claim based on Sega's use of Kirby's likeness, the Court of Appeal did not apply the Rogers
test. Rather, the court used the transformative use test of Comedy III. The court found under that test that the First Amendment barred both the
plainti!'s right of publicity claim and her section 17200 claim. (Kirby, supra, 144 Cal.App.4th at p. 61.)
