includes the overall form as well as the arrangement and composition of spaces and elements in the design, but does not include individual standard features.
“Audiovisual works” are works that consist of a series of related images which are intrinsically intended to be shown by the use of machines, or devices such as
projectors, viewers, or electronic equipment, together with accompanying sounds, if any, regardless of the nature of the material objects, such as ﬁlms or tapes, in
which the works are embodied.
The “Berne Convention” is the Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, signed at Berne, Switzerland, on September 9, 1886, and all acts,

suitable for its purposes.
A person’s “children” are that person’s immediate oﬀspring, whether legitimate or not, and any children legally adopted by that person.

works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole.
A “compilation” is a work formed by the collection and assembling of preexisting materials or of data that are selected, coordinated, or arranged in such a way that

A work is “created” when it is ﬁxed in a copy or phonorecord for the ﬁrst time; where a work is prepared over a period of time, the portion of it that has been ﬁxed at
any particular time constitutes the work as of that time, and where the work has been prepared in diﬀerent versions, each version constitutes a separate work.
A “derivative work” is a work based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, ﬁctionalization, motion picture

A work is “ﬁxed” in a tangible medium of expression when its embodiment in a copy or phonorecord, by or under the authority of the author, is suﬃciently permanent
or stable to permit it to be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory duration. A work consisting of sounds, images, or

performance or display of a work does not of itself constitute publication.

a supplementary work, as a compilation, as an instructional text, as a test, as answer material for a test, or as an atlas, if the parties expressly agree in a written
instrument signed by them that the work shall be considered a work made for hire. For the purpose of the foregoing sentence, a “supplementary work” is a work

answer material for tests, bibliographies, appendixes, and indexes, and an “instructional text” is a literary, pictorial, or graphic work prepared for publication and with
the purpose of use in systematic instructional activities.
In determining whether any work is eligible to be considered a work made for hire under paragraph (2), neither the amendment contained in section 1011(d) of the
Intellectual Property and Communications Omnibus Reform Act of 1999, as enacted by section 1000(a)(9) of Public Law 106–113
(http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-106publ113/html/PLAW-106publ113.htm), nor the deletion of the words added by that amendment—
(A) shall be considered or otherwise given any legal signiﬁcance, or
(B) shall be interpreted to indicate congressional approval or disapproval of, or acquiescence in, any judicial determination,
by the courts or the Copyright Oﬃce. Paragraph (2) shall be interpreted as if both section 2(a)(1) of the Work Made For Hire and Copyright Corrections Act of 2000
and section 1011(d) of the Intellectual Property and Communications Omnibus Reform Act of 1999, as enacted by section 1000(a)(9) of Public Law 106–113
(http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-106publ113/html/PLAW-106publ113.htm), were never enacted, and without regard to any inaction or awareness by the
Congress at any time of any judicial determinations.
