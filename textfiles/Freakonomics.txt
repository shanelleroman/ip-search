The Lanham Act Goes to the
Movies

April 21, 2010 @ 10:30am
by Ian Ayres

 

 

An occupational hazard of teaching intellectual property for the
ﬁrst time is that IP violations now repeatedly jump to mind. (I’m a
bit like the hypochondriac med student who imagines
encountering all the illnesses she just studied.)

Last week was no exception. My beloved spouse and I had a
date night where we went to see the movie Date Night. (I’m a
big fan of both Tina Fey and Steve Carell, but, like many critics,
I was underwhelmed by the movie. The extended dancing scene
was a particular misstep.) Aside from the movie’s artistic merit, I,
as a newbie IP professor, was surprised by the movie’s use of a
Kindle, the Amazon book reader.

***Mild Spoiler Alert***

Steve Carell’s character asks a New York cab driver if he has a
laptop or some device that can read a ﬂash drive (also referred
to in the movie by the less tech-savvy Tina Fey character as a
“computer stickie thing”). The driver responds that he has a
Kindle, and Carell’s character then proceeds to insert the ﬂash

sugar should be regulated,
like alcohol and tobacco, on
the grounds that it’s addictive
and toxic. How much sense
does that make?...

drive into the Kindle and immediately display certain
incriminating pictures taken from the drive.

As an initial matter, do cab drivers really have Kindles in their
cabs? Here’s a mini-bleg: please add a comment if you’ve seen
a cab driver with a Kindle (or if you’re a cab driver and keep one
in your car from time to time). I’d be amazed if 10 cab drivers in
New York City have Kindles currently in their cabs. I mention the
implausibility of ﬁnding a Kindle because it makes me think that
Amazon probably paid for the “product placement.” (I have
ridden in many cabs where the driver has a ﬂash drive-
compatible laptop, which would have been the more natural
device for the driver in the movie to offer.)

But my larger concern is that Kindles can’t read ﬂash drives.
They don’t have USB ports. (Second mini-bleg: is there some
snap-on adapter that would allow you to download ﬁles from a
ﬂash drive? This user board suggests I’m not alone in thinking
that the movie attributes to the Kindle a feature that it simply
doesn’t have.)

If my two conjectures are correct (i.e., that Amazon paid for the
Kindle product placement, and that Kindles can’t read ﬂash
drives in the way depicted in the movie), then it seems to me
that the movie violates the Lanham Act.

You see, Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act (our nation’s core
trademark provision) prohibits false or misleading advertising:

Any person who, on or in connection with any
goods or services . . . uses in commerce any
word, term, name, symbol, or device . . . which in
commercial advertising or promotion,
misrepresents the nature, characteristics [or]
qualities . . . of his or her or another person’s
goods . . . shall be liable in a civil action by any
person who believes that he or she is or is likely
to be damaged by such act.

If Amazon paid for the product placement, it qualiﬁes as a
“commercial advertis[ement] or promotion” that “misrepresents
the nature, characteristics [or] qualities” of the Kindle.

I think it would be ﬁne for movies to take some artistic license
with the qualities of a product if it is clear to the audience that
the qualities are the script writer’s fantasy. For example, if Carell
and Fey traveled through time by unlocking a hidden Kindle
time-machine function, I don’t think there would be any liability
(even if Amazon paid for the placement).

But what is troubling about the Kindle reference in “Date Night”
is that it is not depicted as fantasy, but as an actual attribute of
the product. There may be actual audience members who go
out and buy a Kindle in part because of the movie’s depiction,
and then are surprised to learn that the device cannot download
ﬁles directly from a ﬂash drive.

Any competitor “who believes that he or she is or is likely to be
damaged” by this misrepresentation has standing to bring suit.
Heads up Apple, Microsoft, and Barnes & Noble: you have a
colorable claim. If I were the maker of the Onda VX560, I’d be
particularly put out by “the ad” because the VX560 reader has a
USB port and can actually download ﬁles from a ﬂash drive.

I say this with no animus toward Amazon. Indeed, I love my
Kindle. It let me discover something about
SuperFreakonomics that I never would have found without it.
The Kindle has improved the quality of my reading
experience (even if I haven’t ﬁgured out how to download ﬁles
from my ﬂash drive).

But in a world where product placements are on the rise, it is
entirely appropriate that our deceptive advertising laws respond.
Merely wrapping an ad inside a work of art should not empower
advertisers to misrepresent the attributes of their products.

It appears the kindle does have a USB connection, but
only to connect it to a computer. See below from
amazon.com website.

Transferring Files Via USB

Both Macintosh and Windows users can download and
transfer Kindle content, personal documents, and MP3
and Audible ﬁles from their computers to their Kindles
through the USB connection. When your Kindle is
plugged into your computer, your Kindle will appear as
a removable mass-storage device.

Wouldn't you have to make the case that dramatization
within a movie scene is "in commerce"?

I could see a court being persuaded to rule that way,
but not automatically. Is there any precedent for that?

@Eric -- it's not a movie, it's an ad within a movie. Just
because it "ﬁts" in the "narrative structure" doesn't
change what it actually is.

Movies are very poor representations of technology.
Always have been. A side effect of working with
technology professionally is that you can barely stand
to watch movies where computers or technology takes
any role at all. The things they do with computers are
preposterous and almost always entirely wrong.

The Kindle has a micro USB connector, so a ﬂash drive
is not compatible.

I have a computer science degree. Anytime computers
enter into a movie, their abilities are exaggerated. For
example: "zoom in on his face...enhance by 10x...that's
our man" Chloe in 24 is probably the my favorite
character ever - just for her ability to take advantage of
these futuristic technologies.

Eric is right. It's just a movie. No more can be expected
than would be from CSI's science or legal advice from
The Practice.

I'm an antitrust lawyer and frequently lack the ability to
compartmentalize antitrust doctrine from my daily life
(e.g., wondering whether local retailers selling cub
scouts equipment are engaging in impermissible cartel
behavior), so I empathize. That said, because there are
so many ﬂights of fancy in Date Night (the chase scene
involving a cab locked together with an Audi R8 wasn't
exactly believable), I think it's unlikely that the putative
"reasonable" consumer would presume that the movie
depicts the Kindle's features in a factually accurate
manner. Furthermore, and I don't have a clue about the
case law here, even if Amazon paid a fee to have the
product placed in the ﬁlm, I wonder if the obviously
ﬁctional nature of the movie subverts the notion that the

matter entirely . . .
A usb connection is asymmetric, and requires a "host"
that can then connect to one or more devices. A kindle
is not able to be a host, not is a usb drive.

April 21, 2010 @ 4:12pm

You could only connect the two if you have some
device that could act as a host for both of them (serving
as an intermediary between them).

Despite all this, it doesn't seem all that deceptive that
they'd show this in a movie. Not as a way to try to
deceive people about the function of the kindle, but just
because there isn't a good well-known device that
could plausibly serve the function they needed for this
scene in the movie.

If this was a valid Lanham Act-able representation,
does that mean people could sue over ads or product
placements that happen to feature people enjoying
XBoxes not plugged into TVs or Game Boys with no
game cartridges in them? If so, I wonder why no one's
done so yet.

What about movies where cell phones work
underground, in subways, under tunnels, etc? It
wouldn't necessarily advertise a particular carrier, but
I'm sure a lot of different technologies get
misrepresented in movies.

I don't think the Lexus that Tom Cruise drove in The

I this this is a very interesting point- but there may need

misrepresenting the quality of the vehicle.

I haven't seen the ﬁlm, but I don't think it's a foregone
conclusion that Amazon paid for product placement,
either. The Kindle is undisputably the most used and
most recognized brand name for a "reader" device and
thus the obvious choice for a scriptwriter who wants to
feature such a device, even in the absence of ﬁnancial
compensation for doing so. Saying "I've got a tablet-
style reader" is a little awkward, the iPad was not yet
introduced when the movie was ﬁlmed, and reference
to a "Nook" would potentially be alien to many viewers.

I'm sure Freakonomics lived up to its own high
standards when it stated in the blog regarding the
Iceland volcano: "If this eruption is anything like the
1815 eruption of Mount Tambora".

I'm sure they wouldn't say this if it wasn't a real danger,
would they?

I can totally imagine a scenario where someone
remembers 'Kindles have a port for a USB drive'
without actually remembering where they heard that
information in the ﬁrst place. And would they remember
to check closely the specs before purchasing? Maybe,
maybe not.

The jump from "The ﬁlm contains clips of the Kindle

Anybody expecting technical accuracy in a movie
needs to call me about some ocean front property in
Arizona I have for sale. When technology becomes part
of the plot the writers make it capable of doing
whatever it must to move the story along. It doesn't
matter if it is warp drive, on-demand repositioning of
satellites that can read newsprint or uploading a virus
to aliens to save the Earth, "movie technology" and
"real word technology" share few attributes.
