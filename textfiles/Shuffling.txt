On Tuesday, a federal judge in Florida shot down a big part of
the lawsuit from hip-hop superstar Rick Ross over LMFAO's
chart-topping 2010 song "Party Rock Anthem," which contains
the phrase "Everyday I'm shuﬄin' " in the chorus.

Ross claims that the Los Angeles-based electropop duo's hit is
a copyright infringement of his own chart-topper "Hustlin',"
which contains the lyric "Everyday I'm hustlin'." The song was
released on Ross' 2006 debut album, Port of Miami.

U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams was asked to address on
summary judgment whether Ross' three-word phrase is
original enough to be copyrightable.

"The question presented, however, is not whether the the Iyrics
of Hustlin', as arranged in their entirety, are subject to
copyright protection," she writes in her opinion (read here).
"The question is whether the use of a three word phrase
appearing in the musical composition, divorced from the
accompanying music, modiﬁed, and subsequently printed on
merchandise, constitutes an infringement of the musical
composition Hustlin'. The answer, quite simply, is that it does
not."

The judge points to other cases where short phrases like "you
got the right one, uh-huh," "holla back," "we get it poppin'," and
"caught up" failed to meet the originality threshold when
divorced from the music. She also writes there's evidence that
Ross wasn't the ﬁrst to come up with the lyric "Everyday I'm
hustlin'."

She adds that even if Ross' phrase was copyrightable in this
merchandise context, he would fail the intrinsic test, the one
where ordinary observers judge similarity. "The average lay
observer would not confuse t-shirts bearing the phrase
'everyday I'm shuﬄin'' with the musical composition Hustlin',
nor without reference to Party Rock Anthem and Hustlin',
would an average lay observer recognize the merchandise as
having been appropriated from Hustlin'."

The lawsuit continues and is nearly at trial, but that proceeding
will only be about the songs. LMFAO's Stefan Kendal Gordy
(Redfoo) and Skyler Austen Gordy (SkyBlu) are defendants as
