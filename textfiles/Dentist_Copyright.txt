A lawsuit regarding a dentist and herticked-off patient was meant to be a testof a controversial copyright contractcreated by a company called MedicalJustice. Just a day after the lawsuit wasﬁled, though, Medical Justice backeddown, saying it was “retiring” that contract.Now, more than a year after the lawsuitwas ﬁled, the case against Dr. StacyMakhnevich seems to have turned into acase about a fugitive dentist. Makhnevichis nowhere to be found, won’t defend thelawsuit, and her lawyers have asked towithdraw from the case.No-criticism contractpromised additional“privacy”In 2010, Robert Lee was experiencingserious dental pain. He went to see Dr.Stacy Makhnevich, the “Classical SingerDentist of New York,” in part because shewas a preferred provider for his dentalinsurance company. Before Makhnevichtreated him, she asked him to sign acontract titled “Mutual Agreement toMaintain Privacy.”The contractworked like this:in return forclosing“loopholes” inHIPAA privacy law,Lee promised torefrain frompublishing any“commentary” ofmidtowndentist.comHow To Turn Shadow IT’s RisksInto InnovationSPONSOR CONTENTDentist who used copyright to silence her patients is on the run | Ars Technica

Makhnevich,
online or elsewhere. The contract
speciﬁed that Lee should “not denigrate,
defame, disparage, or cast aspersions
upon the Dentist.”

And the kicker: if he did write such
reviews, the copyright would be assigned
to the dentist. She’d own it.

This “I own your criticism” contract would
soon be put to the test, because Lee was
an extremely unhappy customer. “Avoid at
all cost!” he wrote in a one-star Yelp
review. “Scamming their customers!
Overcharged me by about $4000 for what
should have been only a couple-hundred
dollar procedure.”

The forms Makhnevich was using,
provided to her by a company called
Medical Justice, were already the subject
of considerable controversy. Two tech-
savvy law professors, Eric Goldman of
Santa Clara University and Jason Schultz of
UC Berkeley, launched a website to ﬁght
the contracts, which garnered
considerable press. Former Ars Technica
writer Tim Lee chronicled his own
experience with a Philadelphia dentist
who was using the contract.

The “Mutual Agreement” was essentially a
work-around to try to stiﬂe patient
reviews. Doctors, or any other business,
who believe that an online review is, say,
defamatory, can go ahead and sue a
reviewer—but they don’t have an easy way
to get the review down. Review sites like
Yelp are protected by Section 230 of the
Communications Decency Act, which

immunizes the platforms hosting such
user-generated content, as long as they
don’t edit it heavily. Review sites in the US
don’t typically remove posts when a
business claims defamation.

Copyright, however, is a different story.
Section 230 doesn’t cover intellectual
property laws, and Yelp has to react
quickly to claims that a user has violated
copyright law.

Users of the Medical Justice form were
counting on that, and it worked. In
September 2011, staff members of Dr.
Makhnevich sent DMCA takedown notices
to Yelp and DoctorBase. That was followed
up with invoices sent to Robert Lee, saying
he owed $100 per day for copyright
infringement. Accompanying letters
threatened to pursue “all legal actions”
against him.

Makhnevich
disappears: The
Streisand Effect “gone
bonkers”

Lee got in touch with attorney Paul Levy at
Public Citizen, who has a history of taking
on Internet free-speech issues, and was
looking for a way to challenge the Medical
Justice contract. In November 2011, Public
Citizen ﬁled a lawsuit seeking class action
status, arguing that Lee’s reviews were fair
use and non-defamatory. The lawsuit also
alleged that Makhnevich’s “don’t criticize
me” contracts were violations of New York
business laws and dental ethics rules.

Levy envisioned a courtroom showdown
with Medical Justice—but the case hasn’t
panned out that way. Medical Justice
hasn't defended the contract. And in the
last few months, Makhnevich seems to
have disappeared entirely. Her own
lawyers can’t get in touch with her. On
Tuesday, US District Judge Paul Crotty held
a conference about whether the lawyers
should be allowed to withdraw from the
case. (They’ll be allowed to, with a few
conditions.)

“Defendant Makhnevich has closed its
business in New York, has closed its
oﬃces, and has not made herself available
to respond to this matter,” wrote
Makhnevich’s lawyers on June 25. At that
time, they hadn’t communicated with
Makhnevich in three months, and that
communication had been through her
assistant.

“We brought this lawsuit to make sure she
stopped and to point out to other dentists
that they couldn't do this,” said Levy in an
interview with Ars. “We thought Medical
Justice would step in to defend her.
Instead, they walked away from it and left
her holding the bag. And now she’s left her
lawyers holding the bag.”

Levy is seeking to get Lee back the money
he was overcharged and to have notice
sent to Makhnevich’s other patients that
the contracts they signed don’t prevent
them from writing reviews. He’s also
seeking to get legal fees paid for; it cost
$3,000 to serve Makhnevich, he noted.

It isn’t clear whether Makhnevich is

practicing dentistry or not, but the
disappearing act she pulled in this case
would suggest she isn’t.

“It’s quite possible that the consequence
of her having this contract is that she had
to give up her dental practice,” said Levy.
“It’s the Streisand effect gone bonkers.”

Unless she shows up soon, the case is
likely to end in a default judgment. At that
point Levy would attempt to collect
payment from her insurance company, or
any other source. “She may have some
assets,” said Levy. “Dental equipment is
not cheap.”
