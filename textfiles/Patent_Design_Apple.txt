Apple v. Samsung and a Fight Over the Patents
for Designs

That buzz you hear out of Silicon
Valley is the sound of a knock
down, drag out fight between
Silicon Valley hardware and
software clans. The question at
the heart of the fight is: Why is
form valued so much higher than
function? What matters more,
form or function?

Throughout Silicon Valley and
around the country,
manufacturers of technology that
will be incorporated into other
companies’ products for sale are
abuzz over a recent court ruling
concerning the obtuse and dusty
subject of design patents. At

stake in a prominent legal case
pitting Apple versus Samsung is
the formula for assessing legal
damages payments when one
company infringes on another
company’s product design. A
design patent – i.e., a grant of
legal protection for the
ornamental look and feel of a
product – gives the patent holder
the ability to seek massive
compensation from those that
allegedly violate that design. The
US Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit is set to decide
whether the design patent
holder, in this case Apple, is
entitled to total profits for the
entire value of each infringing
product, sold by Samsung,
despite the incorporation of
other technologies, or whether
the compensation should be
limited only to damages for the
percentage of the product value
ascribed to the design.

While this case pits tech
companies against each other,
the implications of a decision in
Apple’s favor would ripple
throughout our economy as even
simple products begin to
incorporate other companies’
patented technologies. For

example, manufacturers of
refrigerators, cars, and factory
equipment that incorporate
ornamental features into a user
interface like a common icon
into their products for the
coming Internet of Things
revolution could be deeply
affected.

Several years ago on a trip to the
Museum of Modern Art (MOMA)
I stumbled into a fantastic show
on modern design as art.
Prominently displayed in the
curated collection of useful, but
beautifully crafted objects for
modern living were a handful of
earlier Apple products. They
were rightfully displayed as art.
Since that curated show, Apple’s
designers could likely boast that
they have produced another
gallery full of product designs
that could merit their own show
or inclusion in an updated
MOMA show.

Apple’s influence on design is
everywhere and it is pervasive. A
startup I advise is pushing their
design team for their hardware
to ensure that their final gadget,
when ready for market “would be
something Apple was proud of.”
Apple’s products’ sleek,
distinctive, modern look is
something to emulate and plenty
of companies have tried their
best to do so. Some have even
gone so far as to infringe on their
design patents, no doubt.

Moreover, I will just admit it;
I’m a fan boy for Apple’s super
cool products. Our household is
replete with their phones,
computers, etc. We are an
iHouse cataloguing the last
decade and more of their
equipment.

amalgamations of tens,
hundreds, sometimes even
thousands of other companies’
prior designs and technological
inventions. An estimate from
several years ago guessed that
there were more than 250,000
patents that comprised the
modern smart phone. While
Apple puts it all together and
makes it sing and look stylish,
neither Apple nor most of the
major technology providers are
solely responsible for the state of
mobile technology engineering.

A lower court’s ruling that found
Samsung violated Apple design
patents for its phones simply
misunderstands the nature of
modern technologies as gigantic
compilations of thousands of
inventions. Engineering of
computing products is a building
exercise. Like the layers of
modern Rome, the new modern
city is built upon layer upon
layer of historically important
but critical infrastructure. The
further you dig down, the more
you find that was put in place by
others that came before but that
still sets the foundation for the
modern city.

especially smart phones – is
analogous. Each finished
product that gets sold to
consumers is not separate from
the layers of important computer
engineering milestones that
came before. Rather, those
modern technologies tightly and
efficiently integrate the
engineering of other companies
and other earlier inventors, and
are enhanced with new functions
and features to attract consumer
interest and drive demand.

None of this diminishes the
importance of design patents.
Designers should rightfully be
able to claim the proceeds of
inventions and innovations that
create truly new designs. We
want truly creative, novel,
beautiful, and useful designs to
be rewarded with patent
protection; but awarding
damages of total profits for
design patent infringement in
the era of constantly evolving
devices overly inflates the role
that form plays over function.

The theory and history of design
patents supports that incentive
structure. Historically, that has
meant that courts enforced
design patent infringement

especially when the product in
question is, in part, dictated by
its design. Simple products that
are not compilations of
inventions work well within this
structure. An infringement on
the design of a unique shovel can
and should be rewarded by the
inventor recouping losses from
others’ knock offs. Similarly,
when Apple’s designs are stolen,
Apple should be compensated
for the value of the design
element in the infringing
product.

However, when the design is
essentially packaging and
integration of component parts
or technologies invented by
others, any finding of design
infringement should only
compensate for the portion of
the product – the design – that
has been infringed upon rather
than the total profits of the
entire product.

Upholding this longstanding
principle will be especially
important to our current and
future economy, which is heavily
reliant on integrating computer
engineering. If the Federal
Circuit Court gets this matter
wrong, overturning longstanding
precedent, it will allow a single
design patent to swallow all the
technological breakthroughs
from hundreds, if not thousands
of technology patent authors,
that came before. That would be
akin to the Federal Circuit Court
crediting the current mayor of
Rome with all the 3,000 years of
genius that lie below the current
city.

Technology companies are
carefully watching the outcome
of Apple v. Samsung to
determine whether their
incentives to continuously
innovate will continue or
whether the loss of total profits
and fear of endless litigation will
prevent companies from
bringing new products to market
in today’s ever evolving digital
age.
