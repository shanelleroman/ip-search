Before MULLIGAN, TIMBERS and VAN GRAAFEILAND, Circuit Judges.

VAN GRAAFEILAND, Circuit Judge:

This is an appeal from orders of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York granting plaintiff's motions for a preliminary injunction prohibiting Pussycat Cinema, Ltd.,
and Michael Zaffarano from distributing or exhibiting the motion picture "Debbie Does Dallas." On
March 14 this Court granted defendants' motion to stay the injunction and ordered an expedited
appeal. The case was argued before us on April 6, following which we dissolved the stay and
reinstated the preliminary injunction. We now affirm the orders of the district court.

5/7/17, 4:08 PM

Plaintiff in this trademark infringement action is Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, Inc., a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Dallas Cowboys Football Club, Inc. Plaintiff employs thirty-six women who
perform dance and cheerleading routines at Dallas Cowboys football games. The cheerleaders have
appeared frequently on television programs and make commercial appearances at such public
events as sporting goods shows and shopping center openings. In addition, plaintiff licenses others
to manufacture and distribute posters, calendars, T-shirts, and the like depicting Dallas Cowboys
Cheerleaders in their uniforms. These products have enjoyed nationwide commercial success, due
largely to the national exposure the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders have received through the news
and entertainment media. Moreover, plaintiff has expended large amounts of money to acquaint
the public with its uniformed cheerleaders and earns substantial revenue from their commercial
appearances.

At all the football games and public events where plaintiff's cheerleaders appear and on all
commercial items depicting the cheerleaders, the women are clad in plaintiff's distinctive uniform.
The familiar outfit consists of white vinyl boots, white shorts, a white belt decorated with blue
stars, a blue bolero blouse, and a white vest decorated with three blue stars on each side of the
front and a white fringe around the bottom. In this action plaintiff asserts that it has a trademark
in its uniform and that defendants have infringed and diluted that trademark in advertising and
exhibiting "Debbie Does Dallas."

1

Pussycat Cinema, Ltd., is a New York corporation which owns a movie theatre in New York City;
Zaffarano is the corporation's sole stockholder. In November 1978 the Pussycat Cinema began to
show "Debbie Does Dallas," a gross and revolting sex film whose plot, to the extent that there is
one, involves a cheerleader at a fictional high school, Debbie, who has been selected to become a
"Texas Cowgirl."   In order to raise enough money to send Debbie, and eventually the entire squad,
to Dallas, the cheerleaders perform sexual services for a fee. The movie consists largely of a series
of scenes graphically depicting the sexual escapades of the "actors". In the movie's final scene
Debbie dons a uniform strikingly similar to that worn by the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders and for
approximately twelve minutes of film footage engages in various sex acts while clad or partially
clad in the uniform. Defendants advertised the movie with marquee posters depicting Debbie in
the allegedly infringing uniform and containing such captions as "Starring Ex Dallas Cowgirl
2
Cheerleader Bambi Woods" and "You'll do more than cheer for this X Dallas Cheerleader."  
Similar advertisements appeared in the newspapers.

Plaintiff brought this action alleging trademark infringement under section 43(a) of the Lanham
Act (15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)), unfair competition, and dilution of trademark in violation of section 368-

d of the New York General Business Law. The district court, in its oral opinion of February 13,
1979, found that "plaintiff ha(d) succeeded in proving by overwhelming evidence the merits of each
one of its contentions." Defendants challenge the validity of all three claims.

A preliminary issue raised by defendants is whether plaintiff has a valid trademark in its
cheerleader uniform.   Defendants argue that the uniform is a purely functional item necessary for
the performance of cheerleading routines and that it therefore is not capable of becoming a
trademark. We do not quarrel with defendants' assertion that a purely functional item may not
become a trademark. See In re Honeywell, Inc., 532 F.2d 180, 182-83 (C.C.P.A. 1976). However, we
do not agree that all of characteristics of plaintiff's uniform serve only a functional purpose or that,
because an item is in part incidentally functional, it is necessarily precluded from being designated
as a trademark. Plaintiff does not claim a trademark in all clothing designed and fitted to allow free
movement while performing cheerleading routines, but claims a trademark in the particular
combination of colors and collocation of decorations that distinguish plaintiff's uniform from those
of other squads.   Cf. Socony Vacuum Oil Co. v. Rosen, 108 F.2d 632, 636 (6th Cir. 1940); John
Wright, Inc. v. Casper Corp., 419 F. Supp. 292, 317 (E.D. Pa. 1976). It is well established that, if the
design of an item is nonfunctional and has acquired secondary meaning,   the design may become
a trademark even if the item itself is functional. Ives Laboratories, Inc. v. Darby Drug Co., 601 F.2d
631, 642 (2d Cir. 1979); Truck Equipment Service Co. v. Fruehauf Corp., 536 F.2d 1210, 1215 (8th
Cir.), Cert. denied, 429 U.S. 861, 97 S. Ct. 164, 50 L. Ed. 2d 139 (1976). Moreover, when a feature of
the construction of the item is arbitrary, the feature may become a trademark even though it serves
a useful purpose. In re Deister Concentrator Co., 289 F.2d 496, 506, 48 C.C.P.A. 952 (1961);
Fotomat Corp. v. Cochran, 437 F. Supp. 1231 (D. Kan. 1977). Thus, the fact that an item serves or
performs a function does not mean that it may not at the same time be capable of indicating
sponsorship or origin, particularly where the decorative aspects of the item are nonfunctional. See
In re Penthouse International Ltd., 565 F.2d 679, 681 (Cust. & Pat.App.1977). See also In re
World's Finest Chocolate, Inc., 474 F.2d 1012 (Cust. & Pat.App.1973). In the instant case the
combination of the white boots, white shorts, blue blouse, and white star-studded vest and belt is
6
an arbitrary design which makes the otherwise functional uniform trademarkable.

Defendants argue that Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Stiffel Co., 376 U.S. 225, 84 S. Ct. 784, 11 L. Ed. 2d
661 (1964), and Compco Corp. v. Day-Brite Lighting, Inc., 376 U.S. 234, 84 S. Ct. 779, 11 L. Ed. 2d
669 (1964), preclude a finding that plaintiff's uniform is a trademark. We disagree. In Sears-
Compco the Court held merely that a state may not, through its law banning unfair competition,
undermine the federal patent laws by prohibiting the copying of an article that is protected by
neither a federal patent nor a federal copyright. For the Court to have held otherwise would have

been to allow states to grant a monopoly to a producer where the federal government had
specifically determined that free competition should prevail. This consideration does not apply in a
trademark infringement action where the plaintiff does not assert exclusive rights to the sale of a
product but merely to a mark indicating its origin or sponsorship. The question presented
therefore is one of trademark law, and it is clear that Sears-Compco did not redefine the
permissible scope of the law of trademarks insofar as it applies to origin and sponsorship. See
Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Stiffel, supra, 376 U.S. at 232, 84 S. Ct. 784; Ives Laboratories, Inc. v.
Darby Drug Co., supra, at 642 nn. 13-14; Flexitized, Inc. v. National Flexitized Corp., 335 F.2d 774,
781 n. 4 (2d Cir. 1964), Cert. denied, 380 U.S. 913, 85 S. Ct. 889,13 L. Ed. 2d 799 (1965); Rolls-
Royce Motors Ltd. v. A & A Fiberglass, Inc.,428 F. Supp. 689, 692 (N.D. Ga. 1977).

Having found that plaintiff has a trademark in its uniform, we must determine whether the
depiction of the uniform in "Debbie Does Dallas" violates that trademark. The district court found
that the uniform worn in the movie and shown on the marquee closely resembled plaintiff's
uniform and that the public was likely to identify it as plaintiff's uniform. Our own comparison of
the two uniforms convinces us that the district court was correct,   and defendants do not seriously
contend that the uniform shown in the movie is not almost identical with plaintiff's. Defendant's
contention is that, despite the striking similarity of the two uniforms, the public is unlikely to be
confused within the meaning of section 43(a) of the Lanham Act.

7

Defendants assert that the Lanham Act requires confusion as to the origin of the film, and they
contend that no reasonable person would believe that the film originated with plaintiff. Appellants
read the confusion requirement too narrowly. In order to be confused, a consumer need not believe
that the owner of the mark actually produced the item and placed it on the market. See Syntex
Laboratories, Inc. v. Norwich Pharmacal Co., 437 F.2d 566, 568 (2d Cir. 1971); Boston Professional
Hockey Association v. Dallas Cap & Emblem Mfg., Inc., 510 F.2d 1004, 1012 (5th Cir.), Cert.
denied, 423 U.S. 868, 96 S. Ct. 132, 46 L. Ed. 2d 98 (1975). The public's belief that the mark's
owner sponsored or otherwise approved the use of the trademark satisfies the confusion
requirement. In the instant case, the uniform depicted in "Debbie Does Dallas" unquestionably
brings to mind the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. Indeed, it is hard to believe that anyone who had
seen defendants' sexually depraved film could ever thereafter disassociate it from plaintiff's
cheerleaders. This association results in confusion which has "a tendency to impugn (plaintiff's
services) and injure plaintiff's business reputation . . . ." See Coca-Cola Co. v. Gemini Rising, Inc.,
346 F. Supp. 1183, 1189 (E.D.N.Y. 1972). In the Coca-Cola case the defendant had manufactured a
poster showing the familiar red and white Coca-Cola design with the word "Cocaine" substituted
for "Coca-Cola". As in this case, the defendant there argued that no reasonable purchaser would be

confused by the poster; however the court held that a person of average intelligence could believe
"that defendant's poster was just another effort . . . by plaintiff to publicize its product," although in
a distasteful way. Id. at 1190. In another case, a similarity between the plaintiff's and the
defendant's trade slogans was held to confuse the public and "(threaten) injury to the good name of
the first user." See Chemical Corp. of America v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 306 F.2d 433 (5th Cir.
1962), Cert. denied, 372 U.S. 965, 83 S. Ct. 1089, 10 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1963). There, the defendant
advertised its insecticide by changing plaintiff's slogan "Where there's life, there's Bud" to the
slogan "Where there's life, there's bugs." The court's reasoning in upholding the finding of unfair
competition is equally applicable here:

The gist of this action is that the plaintiff has a property interest in the slogan, built up at great
expense, and that it and its products are favorably known as a result of its use of this property right
and that the defendant, with full knowledge of the right and with the purpose of appropriating
some of the value engendered in the minds of the public by its use has used, and proposes further
to make use of, a deceptively similar slogan in a manner that will bring direct financial loss to the
plaintiff, both by reason of confusing the source of the defendant's product, and by reason of the
peculiarly unwholesome association of ideas when the word "bugs" was substituted in the slogan
for the word "Bud," referring to a food product.
Id. at 437.

Plaintiff expects to establish on trial that the public may associate it with defendants' movie and be
confused into believing that plaintiff sponsored the movie, provided some of the actors, licensed
defendants to use the uniform, or was in some other way connected with the production. The
trademark laws are designed not only to prevent consumer confusion but also to protect "the
synonymous right of a trademark owner to control his product's reputation." James Burrough Ltd.
v. Sign of the Beefeater, Inc., 540 F.2d 266, 274 (7th Cir. 1976) (Markey, C. J.). The district court
did not err in holding that plaintiff had established a likelihood of confusion within the meaning of
the Lanham Act sufficient to entitle it to a preliminary injunction and that plaintiff had a right to
preliminary relief on its claims of unfair competition and dilution.   See id. at 274 n. 16.

Defendants assert that the copyright doctrine of "fair use" should be held applicable to trademark
infringement actions and that we should apply the doctrine to sanction their use of a replica of
plaintiff's uniform. Fair use is "a 'privilege in others than the owner of a copyright to use the
copyrighted material in a reasonable manner without his consent . . . .' " Rosemont Enterprises,
Inc. v. Random House, Inc., 366 F.2d 303, 306 (2d Cir. 1966) (quoting Ball, The Law of Copyright
and Literary Property 260 (1944)), Cert. denied, 385 U.S. 1009, 87 S. Ct. 714, 17 L. Ed. 2d 546

(1967). The fair use doctrine allows adjustments of conflicts between the first amendment and the
copyright laws, See Wainwright Securities Inc. v. Wall Street Transcript Corp., 558 F.2d 91, 95 (2d
Cir. 1977), Cert. denied,434 U.S. 1014, 98 S. Ct. 730, 54 L. Ed. 2d 759 (1978), and is designed
primarily to balance "the exclusive rights of a copyright holder with the public's interest in
dissemination of information affecting areas of universal concern, such as art, science and
industry." Id. at 94. It is unlikely that the fair use doctrine is applicable to trademark
infringements;   however, we need not reach that question. Although, as defendants assert, the
doctrine of fair use permits limited copyright infringement for purposes of parody, See Berlin v. E.
C. Publications, Inc., 329 F.2d 541 (2d Cir. 1964), Cert. denied,379 U.S. 822, 85 S. Ct. 46, 13 L. Ed.
2d 33 (1965), defendants' use of plaintiff's uniform hardly qualifies as parody or any other form of
fair use. See Walt Disney Productions v. Mature Pictures Corp., 389 F. Supp. 1397, 1398 (S.D.N.Y.
1975).

Nor does any other first amendment doctrine protect defendants' infringement of plaintiff's
trademark. That defendants' movie may convey a barely discernible message   does not entitle
them to appropriate plaintiff's trademark in the process of conveying that message. See Interbank
Card Association v. Simms, 431 F. Supp. 131 (M.D.N.C. 1977); Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. v. Manns
Theatres, 195 U.S.P.Q. 159 (C.D. Cal. 1976); Coca-Cola Co. v. Gemini Rising, Inc., supra, 346 F.
Supp. at 1191. Plaintiff's trademark is in the nature of a property right, See Hanover Milling Co. v.
Metcalf, 240 U.S. 403, 413, 36 S. Ct. 357, 60 L. Ed. 713 (1915); Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v.
Dunhill Tailored Clothes, Inc., 293 F.2d 685, 692, 49 C.C.P.A. 730 (1961), Cert. denied, 369 U.S.
864, 82 S. Ct. 1030, 8 L. Ed. 2d 84 (1962), and as such it need not "yield to the exercise of First
Amendment rights under circumstances where adequate alternative avenues of communication
exist." Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, 407 U.S. 551, 567, 92 S. Ct. 2219, 2228, 33 L. Ed. 2d 31 (1972).
Because there are numerous ways in which defendants may comment on "sexuality in athletics"
without infringing plaintiff's trademark, the district court did not encroach upon their first
amendment rights in granting a preliminary injunction. See Walt Disney Productions v. Air
Pirates, 581 F.2d 751, 758-59 (9th Cir. 1978); Reddy Communications, Inc. v. Environmental
Action Foundation, 199 U.S.P.Q. 630, 634 (D.D.C. 1977).

For similar reasons, the preliminary injunction did not constitute an unconstitutional "prior
restraint". This is not a case of government censorship, but a private plaintiff's attempt to protect
its property rights. The propriety of a preliminary injunction where such relief is sought is so clear
that courts have often issued an injunction without even mentioning the first amendment. See, e.
g., Gilliam v. American Broadcasting Cos., 538 F.2d 14 (2d Cir. 1976); Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. v.
Manns Theatres, supra, 195 U.S.P.Q. 159. The prohibition of the Lanham Act is content neutral, Cf.

Schacht v. United States, 398 U.S. 58, 90 S. Ct. 1555, 26 L. Ed. 2d 44 (1970), and therefore does not
arouse the fears that trigger the application of constitutional "prior restraint" principles.

The district court's issuance of a preliminary injunction is reversible only for abuse of discretion.
Taylor Wine Co. v. Bully Hill Vineyards, Inc., 569 F.2d 731, 732 n. 1 (2d Cir. 1978). A preliminary
injunction is proper where the plaintiff establishes possible irreparable harm and either (1)
probable success on the merits or (2) sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make
them a fair ground for litigation and a balance of hardships tipping decidedly in the movant's favor.
Selchow & Righter Co. v. McGraw-Hill Book Co., 580 F.2d 25, 27 (2d Cir. 1978). Plaintiff has
established a probability of success at trial, and the confusion engendered by defendants' movie
would result in irreparable harm to plaintiff were defendants not enjoined from its distribution and
exhibition. See Hills Brothers Coffee, Inc. v. Hills Supermarkets, Inc., 428 F.2d 379, 380-81 (2d
Cir. 1970); See also Taylor Wine Co. v. Bully Hill Vineyards, Inc., supra, 569 F.2d at 732 n. 1.
Accordingly, we affirm the orders of the district court.

Affirmed.

The official appellation of plaintiff's cheerleaders is "Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders", but the district
court found that plaintiff also has a trademark in the names "Dallas Cowgirls" and "Texas
Cowgirls" which have been made popular by the media
 

Bambi Woods, the woman who played the role of Debbie, is not now and never has been a Dallas
Cowboys Cheerleader
 

At present plaintiff does not have a registered trademark or service mark in its uniform. However,
plaintiff still may prevail if it establishes that it has a common law trademark or service mark. See
Boston Professional Hockey Association v. Dallas Cap & Emblem Mfg., Inc., 510 F.2d 1004, 1010
(5th Cir.), Cert. denied, 423 U.S. 991, 96 S. Ct. 408, 46 L. Ed. 2d 312 (1975); New York General

the standards for determining infringement are the same. West & Co. v. Arica Institute, Inc., 557

Plaintiff's design imparts a western flavor appropriate for a Texas cheerleading squad. The design
is in no way essential to the performance of cheerleading routines and to that extent is not a
functional aspect of the uniform
 

Secondary meaning is "(t)he power of a name or other configuration to symbolize a particular
business, product or company . . . ." Ideal Toy Corp. v. Kenner Products Division of General Mills
Fun Group, Inc., 443 F. Supp. 291, 305 n. 14 (S.D.N.Y. 1977). There is no dispute in this case that
plaintiff's uniform is universally recognized as the symbol of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders
 

Although color alone is not capable of becoming a trademark, a combination of colors together
with a distinctive arbitrary design may serve as a trademark. Quabaug Rubber Co. v. Fabiano Shoe
Co., 567 F.2d 154, 161 (1st Cir. 1977)
 

To the extent that a finding of likelihood of confusion is based upon a comparison of the two
marks, See Beech-Nut, Inc. v. Warner Lambert Co., 346 F. Supp. 547, 550 (S.D.N.Y. 1972), Aff'd,
480 F.2d 801 (2d Cir. 1973), the appellate court may make an independent judgment as to the
similarity of the marks. See Hills Brothers Coffee, Inc. v. Hills Supermarkets, Inc., 428 F.2d 379,
380 (2d Cir. 1970)
 

Even if plaintiff had not established a likelihood of confusion, it would be entitled to relief under
New York General Business Law § 368-d, which permits the enjoining of trademark copying
despite the absence of confusion as to source or sponsorship. See Allied Maintenance Corp. v.
Allied Mechanical Trades, Inc., 42 N.Y.2d 538, 543-44, 399 N.Y.S.2d 628, 369 N.E.2d 1162 (1977)

Because the primary purpose of the trademark laws is to protect the public from confusion, See W.
E. Basset Co. v. Revlon, Inc., 354 F.2d 868, 871 (2d Cir. 1966), it would be somewhat anomalous to
hold that the confusing use of another's trademark is "fair use". See also Truck Equipment Service
Co. v. Fruehauf Corp., supra, 536 F.2d at 1215
