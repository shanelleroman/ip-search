You Can Now Buy a $90,000 Richard Prince

Who’s appropriating whom?

Richard Prince, an artist who has spent decades probing the boundaries of art
and the idea of authorship, has drawn fire online recently for a series of works that
was shown at the Frieze New York art fair earlier this month.

The works, part of a series called “New Portraits,” consist of screenshots from

Instagram, complete with the uploaders’ names and comments from users
(including Mr. Prince), blown up and printed on large canvases. Priced at $90,000,
they sold quickly, Vulture reported. There was outrage.

Now one source of some of Mr. Prince’s works is offering a response.

Selena Mooney, who founded the website SuicideGirls, which has sold online

access to erotic images for more than a decade, wrote on Tuesday that she would sell
nearly identical copies of one of the pictures chosen by Mr. Prince.

She offered a steep discount, though. Her versions, five different inkjet prints on

canvas at the same size as Mr. Prince’s, cost just $90. Proceeds will go to the
Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, she said. In the post, she
wrote, “If I had a nickel for every time someone used our images without our
permission in a commercial endeavor I’d be able to spend $90,000 on art.”

The “New Portraits” series was first seen at the Gagosian Gallery on Madison

Avenue last fall, prompting a similar response. Some critics raved; some jeered.

Mr. Prince, who began using appropriated images in his art years before the

founder of Instagram was born, has defended himself, somewhat obliquely, on
Twitter.

Most of his Instagram posts, however, have been removed. The only one that

remained on Wednesday afternoon was an installation view of one of his “New
Portraits,” with Taylor Swift. In the caption, Mr. Prince wrote, “Smile On Your
Brother Come Together Love One Another.”
