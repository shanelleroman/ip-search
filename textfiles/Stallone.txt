Judgment

KELLER, District Judge:

This matter came before the Court on the Motion for Summary
Judgment of defendants Sylvester Stallone, Freddie Fields, Dean
Stolber and MGM/UA Communications Co. Having reviewed the
materials submitted and the arguments of counsel, the Court hereby
ORDERS the Motion GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. The
plaintiff's First Count, for copyright infringement, is dismissed with
prejudice. The plaintiff's Sixth and Tenth Counts for unfair competition
and unjust enrichment are also dismissed with prejudice as is the
breach of confidence claim in Count Twelve. The Motion is DENIED
as to all other counts.

Factual Background

The movies Rocky I, II, and III were extremely successful motion
pictures. Sylvester Stallone wrote each script and played the role of
Rocky Balboa, the dominant character in each of the movies. In May
of 1982, while on a promotional tour for the movie Rocky III, Stallone
informed members of the press of his ideas for Rocky IV. Although
Stallone's description of his ideas would vary slightly in each of the
press conferences, he would generally describe his ideas as follows:

I'd do it [Rocky IV] if Rocky himself could step out a bit.
Maybe tackle world problems.... So what would happen,
say, if Russia allowed her boxers to enter the professional
ranks? Say Rocky is the United States' representative and
the White House wants him to fight with the Russians
before the Olympics. It's in Russia with everything against
him. It's a giant stadium in Moscow and everything is
Russian Red. It's a fight of astounding proportions with 50
monitors sent to 50 countries. It's the World Cup—a war
between 2 countries.

5/7/17, 1:20 PM

June of 1982, after viewing the movie Rocky III, Timothy Anderson
wrote a thirty-one page treatment entitled "Rocky IV" that he hoped
would be used by Stallone and MGM®UA Communications Co.
(hereinafter "MGM") as a sequel to Rocky III. The treatment
incorporated the characters created by Stallone in his prior movies
and cited Stallone as a co-author.

13

14

In October of 1982, Mr. Anderson met with Art Linkletter, who was a
member of MGM's board of directors. Mr. Linkletter set up a meeting
on October 11, 1982, between Mr. Anderson and Mr. Fields, who
was president of MGM at the time. Mr. Linkletter was also present at
this October 11, 1982 meeting. During the meeting, the parties
discussed the possibility that plaintiff's treatment would be used by
defendants as the script for Rocky IV. At the suggestion of Mr. Fields,
the plaintiff, who is a lawyer and was accompanied by a lawyer at
the meeting, signed a release that purported to relieve MGM from
liability stemming from use of the treatment. Plaintiff alleges that Mr.
Fields told him and his attorney that "if they [MGM & Stallone] use his
stuff [Anderson's treatment] it will be big money, big bucks for Tim."
Anderson Depo. at 89–90, 106, 108–109.

On April 22, 1984, Anderson's attorney wrote MGM requesting
compensation for the alleged use of his treatment in the forthcoming
Rocky IV movie. On July 12, 1984, Stallone described his plans for
the Rocky IV script on the Today Show before a national television
audience. Anderson, in his deposition, states that his parents and
friends called him to tell him that Stallone was telling "his story" on
television. Anderson Depo. at pgs. 189–190. In a diary entry of July
12, 1984, Anderson noted that Stallone "explained my story" on
national television. Deposition of Timothy Anderson, Exhibit 140.

15

Stallone completed his Rocky IV script in October of 1984. Rocky IV
was released in November of 1985. The complaint in this action was
filed on January 29, 1987.

III. Plaintiff's Unjust Enrichment And Unfair
Competition Claims Are Preempted By
Federal Copyright Law

On July 20, 1987, this Court denied defendants' motion to dismiss
plaintiff's unjust enrichment claim, finding that it was not preempted by
federal law. However, unbeknownst to the parties and this Court, on
June 23, 1987, the Ninth Circuit held that the plaintiff's unjust
enrichment claim was subject to preemption. Del Madera Properties
v. Rhodes & Gardner, 820 F.2d 973 (9th Cir.1987) (The court held
that plaintiff's unjust enrichment claim based on an unauthorized use
of a copyrighted master plan map was preempted by federal
copyright law.) In the same case, the Ninth Circuit also held that the
plaintiff's unfair competition claim was preempted. Del Madera, 820
F.2d at 977.

32

Surprisingly, Del Madera appears to be a case of first impression in
this circuit on the issue of preemption of unjust enrichment and unfair
competition claims by federal copyright law. However, as shown
below, the opinion comports with the test for determining whether a
cause of action is preempted by federal copyright law under 17
U.S.C. § 301(b) (West 1977).

Section 301 of the federal copyright statute sets forth a two-part test
for determining whether a claim based on state law is preempted by
federal copyright law. First, the work on which the state claim is based
must be within the subject matter of copyright. 17 U.S.C. 301(b)(1).
Second, the state cause of action must protect rights that are
qualitatively equivalent to copyright protection. 17 U.S.C. 301(b)(3).
Under the second prong, courts focus on whether the state claim has
an "extra element" that differentiates the state action from the rights
protected by federal copyright law. See Harper & Row Publishers,
Inc. v. Nation Enterprises 723 F.2d 195, 200 (2nd Cir.1983), rev'd
on other grounds, 471 U.S. 539 (1985).

Under this test, both Anderson's unjust enrichment and unfair trade
practice claims are preempted. Both actions are grounded on the
defendants' alleged use of a written script. This clearly satisfies the first
prong of the test as Anderson's written work of authorship is within the
subject matter of copyright. 17 U.S.C. § 102. Under the second
prong, the defendants allegedly copied and incorporated Anderson's
work into their own script without permission. The federal copyright
laws explicitly protect Anderson's treatment from the copying that
forms the basis for these state causes of action. 17 U.S.C. §§ 106(1)
& (2). There is no "extra element" such as fraud or palming off to save
the unfair competition and unjust enrichment claims from preemption.
See Ronald Litoff, Ltd. v. American Express Corp., 621 F.Supp. 981,
984–85 (D.C.N.Y.1985).

Plaintiff's original opposition to the defendant's motion to dismiss the
unjust enrichment claims raised two arguments that warrant discussion
by the Court. First, plaintiff argued that portions of his script taken
unjustly may not raise to the level of an infringement under copyright
laws, but would still constitute unjust enrichment. However, under the
preemption test set forth in section 301(b)(1), if the subject matter as a
whole falls within federal copyright law, then a plaintiff may not avoid
preemption by claiming that the copying, while permissible under the
federal laws, would violate an equivalent state law.

39

Plaintiff can only avoid preemption of his state law claims that fall
within the subject matter of copyright if these claims involve a
"qualitatively" different right, not a "quantitatively" different right. As
the Second Circuit opined in Harper & Row in finding that state claims
for both conversion and tortious interference with contractual rights
were preempted:

The fact that portions of the Ford memoirs may consist of
uncopyrightable material ... does not take the work as a
whole outside the subject matter protected by the Act.
(citations omitted) Were this not so, states would be free
to expand the perimeters of copyright protection to their
own liking, on the theory that preemption would be no
bar to state protection of material not meeting federal
statutory standards. That interpretation would run directly
afoul of one of the Act's central purposes, to "avoid the
development of any vague borderline areas between
State and Federal protection." (citations omitted)

Harper & Row, 723 F.2d 195, 200.

Plaintiff's argument is rejected implicitly by the Ninth Circuit in Del
Madera; in the language of Section 301(b)(3); and in the thorough
reasoning of the Second Circuit in Harper & Row.

Second, plaintiff argues that his unjust enrichment claim should not be
preempted because it is equivalent to an action for breach of
confidence that is not preempted. However, there is an "extra
element" of a confidential relationship in a breach of confidence claim
that differentiates it from an unjust enrichment claim and prevents
preemption under Section 301(b)(3). As other courts have noted, a
breach of confidence claim is "nonequivalent to the rights one can
acquire under copyright law; rather it rests on an obligation not to
disclose to third parties ideas revealed in confidence...." Smith v.
Weinstein, 578 F.Supp. 1297, 1307 (S.D.N.Y.1984). Plaintiff's unjust
enrichment and unfair competition claims do not incorporate any such
"nonequivalent" right and are preempted by federal copyright law.

IV. Defendants Are Entitled To Summary
Judgment On Anderson's Copyright
Infringement Claims

This Court finds that the defendants are entitled to summary judgment
on plaintiff's copyright infringement claims on two separate grounds.
First, Anderson's treatment is an infringing work that is not entitled to
copyright protection. Second, Rocky IV is not substantially similar to
Anderson's treatment, and no reasonable jury could find that Rocky IV
is a picturization of Anderson's script.

A. Defendants Are Entitled To Summary
Judgment Because Anderson's Treatment Is
An Infringing Work That Is Not Entitled To
Copyright Protection

The Court finds that Anderson's treatment is not entitled to copyright
protection. This finding is based upon the following determinations that
will be delineated further below: (a) the Rocky characters developed
in Rocky I, II and III constitute expression protected by copyright
independent from the story in which they are contained; (b)
Anderson's treatment appropriated these characters and created a
derivative work based upon these characters without Stallone's
permission in violation of Section 106(2); (c) no part of Anderson's
treatment is entitled to copyright protection as his work is pervaded by
the characters of the first three Rocky movies that are afforded
copyright protection.

1. Visually Depicted Characters Can Be
Granted Copyright Protection

The precise legal standard this Court should apply in determining
when a character may be afforded copyright protection is fraught
with uncertainty. The Second Circuit has followed Judge Learned

https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/collages/31817

Hand's opinion in Nichols v. Universal Pictures, 45 F.2d 119
(2d.Cir.1930),cert. denied, 282 U.S. 902 (1931). Judge Hand set
forth a test, simple in theory but elusive in application, to determine
when a character should be granted copyright protection. Essentially,
under this test, copyright protection is granted to a character if it is
developed with enough specificity so as to constitute protectable
expression. Id. at 121.

This circuit originally created a more rigorous test for granting
copyright protection to characters. In Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. v.
Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., (hereinafter the "Sam Spade"
opinion) this circuit held that the literary character Sam Spade was not
copyrightable, opining that a character could not be granted
copyright protection unless it "constituted the story being told". 216
F.2d 945, 950 (9th Cir.1954). The Sam Spade case has not been
explicitly overruled by this circuit and its requirement that a character
"constitute the story being told" appears to greatly circumscribe the
protection of characters in this circuit.

Subsequent decisions in the Ninth Circuit cast doubt on the reasoning
and implicitly limit the holding of the Sam Spade case. In Walt Disney
Productions v. Air Pirates, this circuit held that several Disney comic
characters were protected by copyright. 581 F.2d 751, 755 (9th
Cir.1978). In doing so the Court of Appeals reasoned that because
"comic book characters ... are distinguishable from literary characters,
the Warner Bros language does not preclude protection of Disney's
characters." Id. Air Pirates can be interpreted as either attempting to
harmonize granting copyright protection to graphic characters with
the "story being told" test enunciated in the Sam Spade case or
narrowing the "story being told" test to characters in literary works. If
Air Pirates is construed as holding that the graphic characters in
question constituted the story being told, it does little to alter the Sam
Spade opinion. However, it is equally as plausible to interpret Air
Pirates as applying a less stringent test for protectability of graphic
characters.

Professor Nimmer has adopted the latter reading as he interprets Air
Pirates as limiting the story being told requirement to word portraits. 1
M. Nimmer, THE LAW OF COPYRIGHT, § 2–12, pg. 2–176 (1988).
Further, Professor Nimmer finds that the reasoning of the Sam Spade
case is undermined by the Air Pirates opinion, even as it relates to
word portraits. Id. This is true because the use of a less stringent test
for protection of characters in the graphic medium casts doubt on the
vitality of the more stringent story being told test for graphic
characters. As a practical matter, a graphically depicted character is
much more likely than a literary character to be fleshed out in
sufficient detail so as to warrant copyright protection. But this fact
does not warrant the creation of separate analytical paradigms for
protection of characters in the two mediums.

This circuit's most recent decision on the issue of copyrightability of
characters, Olson v. National Broadcasting Corporation, 855 F.2d
1446 (9th Cir.1988) does little to clarify the uncertainties in this circuit
as to how the Air Pirates decision affects the continued viability of the
Sam Spade test. In Olson, the Court of Appeals cited with approval
the Sam Spade "story being told test" and declined to characterize
this language as dicta. Id. at 1451–52 n. 6. The Court then cited Air
Pirates along with Second Circuit precedent and "recognize[d] that
cases subsequent to Warner Bros [Sam Spade] have allowed
copyright protection for characters who are especially distinctive." Id.
at 1452. Olson also stated definitively that "copyright protection may
be afforded to characters visually depicted in a television series or in
a movie." Id. But later in the opinion, the court in Olson distanced itself
from the character delineation test that these cases employed,
referring to it as "the more lenient standards adopted elsewhere". Id.

In an implicit acknowledgment of the unsettled state of the law, in
considering the characters at issue in Olson, the circuit court evaluates
the characters in the suit under both tests. Id. at 1452–53.

2. The Rocky Characters Are Entitled To
Copyright Protection As A Matter Of Law

https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/collages/31817

53

Olson's evaluation of literary characters is clearly distinguishable from
the visually depicted characters of the first three Rocky movies for
which the defendant seeks protection here. Thus, the more restrictive
"story being told test" is inapplicable to the facts of this case.Air
Pirates, 581 F.2d at 755, 1 M. Nimmer, § 2–12, pg 2–176.
However, out of an abundance of caution this Court will determine
the protectability of the Rocky characters under both tests. As shown
below, the Rocky characters are protected from bodily appropriation
under either standard.

The Rocky characters are one of the most highly delineated group of
characters in modern American cinema. The physical and emotional
characteristics of Rocky Balboa and the other characters were set
forth in tremendous detail in three Rocky movies before Anderson
appropriated the characters for his treatment. The interrelationships
and development of Rocky, Adrian, Apollo Creed, Clubber Lang,
and Paulie are central to all three movies. Rock Balboa is such a
highly delineated character that his name is the title of all four of the
Rocky movies and his character has become identified with specific
character traits ranging from his speaking mannerisms to his physical
characteristics. This Court has no difficulty ruling as a matter of law
that the Rocky characters are delineated so extensively that they are
protected from bodily appropriation when taken as a group and
transposed into a sequel by another author. Plaintiff has not and
cannot put before this Court any evidence to rebut the defendants'
showing that Rocky characters are so highly delineated that they
warrant copyright protection.

54

Plaintiff's unsupported assertions that Rocky is merely a stock
character, made in the face of voluminous evidence that the Rocky
characters are copyrightable, do not bar this Court from granting
summary judgment on this issue. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477
U.S. 242, 247–48 (1986) ("the mere existence of some alleged
factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise
properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is
that there be no genuine issue of material fact.") (emphasis in

https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/collages/31817

Page 10 of 29

Anderson v. Stallone, 11 USPQ2D 1161 (C.D. Cal. 1989)

5/7/17, 1:20 PM

original). If any group of movie characters is protected by copyright,
surely the Rocky characters are protected from bodily appropriation
into a sequel which merely builds on the relationships and
characteristics which these characters developed in the first three
Rocky movies. No reasonable jury could find otherwise.

This Court need not and does not reach the issue of whether any
single character alone, apart from Rocky, is delineated with enough
specificity so as to garner copyright protection. Nor does the Court
reach the issue of whether these characters are protected from less
than bodily appropriation. See 1 M. Nimmer, § 2.12, pg. 2–171
(copyrightability of characters is "more properly framed as relating to
the degree of substantial similarity required to constitute infringement
rather than in terms of copyrightability per se").

This Court also finds that the Rocky characters were so highly
developed and central to the three movies made before Anderson's
treatment that they "constituted the story being told". All three Rocky
movies focused on the development and relationships of the various
characters. The movies did not revolve around intricate plots or story
lines. Instead, the focus of these movies was the development of the
Rocky characters. The same evidence which supports the finding of
delineation above is so extensive that it also warrants a finding that
the Rocky characters—Rocky, Adrian, Apollo Creed, Clubber Lang,
and Paulie—"constituted the story being told" in the first three Rocky
movies.

3. Anderson's Work is An Unauthorized
Derivative Work

Under 17 U.S.C. section 106(2), the holder of a copyright has the
exclusive right to prepare derivative works based upon his
copyrighted work. In this circuit a work is derivative "only if it would
be considered an infringing work if the material which it had derived
from a prior work had been taken without the consent of the copyright
proprietor of the prior work." Litchfield v. Spielberg, 736 F.2d 1352,

1354 (9th Cir.1984) (emphasis in original), citing United States v.
Taxe, 540 F.2d 961, 965 n. 2 (9th Cir.1976). This Court must now
examine whether Anderson's treatment is an unauthorized derivative
work under this standard.

Usually a court would be required to undertake the extensive
comparisons under the Krofft substantial similarity test to determine
whether Anderson's work is a derivative work. See 1 M. Nimmer, §
3.01 at 3–3; pgs. 25–28 supra. However, in this case, Anderson has
bodily appropriated the Rocky characters in his treatment. This Court
need not determine whether the characters in Anderson's treatment
are substantially similar to Stallone's characters, as it is uncontroverted
that the characters were lifted lock, stock, and barrel from the prior
Rocky movies. Anderson retained the names, relationships and built
on the experiences of these characters from the three prior Rocky
movies. 1 M. Nimmer, § 2.12 at 2–177 (copying names of
characters is highly probative evidence of infringement). His
characters are not merely substantially similar to Stallone's, they are
Stallone's characters. As Professor Nimmer stated, "Where there is
literal similarity.... [i]t is not necessary to determine the level of
abstraction at which similarity ceases to consist of an 'expression of
ideas' since literal similarity by definition is always a similarity as to
the expression of ideas." 3 M. Nimmer, § 13.03[3], pg. 13–35.
Anderson's bodily appropriation of these characters infringes upon
the protected expression in the Rocky characters and renders his work
an unauthorized derivative work. 1 Nimmer, § 2.12 at 2–171. By
bodily appropriating the significant elements of protected expression
in the Rocky characters, Anderson has copied protected expression
and his treatment infringes on Stallone's copyrighted work.

60

4. Since Anderson's Work Is An Unauthorized
Derivative Work, No Part Of The Treatment
Can Be Granted Copyright Protection

61

Stallone owns the copyrights for the first three Rocky movies. Under
17 U.S.C. section 106(2), he has the exclusive right to prepare

https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/collages/31817

Page 12 of 29

Anderson v. Stallone, 11 USPQ2D 1161 (C.D. Cal. 1989)

5/7/17, 1:20 PM

derivative works based on these copyrighted works. This Court has
determined that Anderson's treatment is an unauthorized derivative
work. Thus, Anderson has infringed upon Stallone's copyright. See 17
U.S.C. section 501(a).

Nevertheless, plaintiff contends that his infringing work is entitled to
copyright protection and he can sue Stallone for infringing upon his
treatment. Plaintiff relies upon 17 U.S.C. section 103(a) as support for
his position that he is entitled to copyright protection for the non-
infringing portions of his treatment. 17 U.S.C. section 103(a) reads:

The subject matter of copyright as specified by section
102 includes compilations and derivative works, but
protection for a work employing preexisting material in
which copyright subsists does not extend to any part of
the work in which the material has been used unlawfully.

Plaintiff has not argued that section 103(a), on its face, requires that
an infringer be granted copyright protection for the non-infringing
portions of his work. He has not and cannot provide this Court with a
single case that has held that an infringer of a copyright is entitled to
sue a third party for infringing the original portions of his work. Nor
can he provide a single case that stands for the extraordinary
proposition he proposes here, namely, allowing a plaintiff to sue the
party whose work he has infringed upon for infringement of his
infringing derivative work.

Instead, Anderson alleges that the House Report on section 103(a)
indicates that Congress intended protection for the non-infringing
portions of derivative works such as his treatment. The House Report
for section 103(a) first delineates the differences between
compilations and derivative works. H.R. No. 1476, 94th Cong., 2d
Sess. at 57–58 (1976). The House Report then reads as follows:

The second part of the sentence that makes up section
103(a) [subsec. (a) of this section] deals with the status of
a compilation or derivative work unlawfully employing

preexisting copyrighted material. In providing that
protection does not extend to "any part of the work in
which such material has been used unlawfully," the bill
prevents an infringer from benefiting, through copyright
protection, from committing an unlawful act, but preserves
protection for those parts of the work that do not employ
the preexisting work. Thus, an unauthorized translation of
a novel could not be copyrighted at all, but the owner of
copyright in an anthology of poetry could sue someone
who infringed the whole anthology, even though the
infringer proves that publication of one of the poems was
unauthorized.

67

68

69

The Court recognizes that the House Report language is muddled. It
makes a general statement that non-infringing portions of a work
should be granted protection if these portions do not employ the pre-
existing work. The report then provides two examples: one involving a
compilation where the non-infringing portion was deemed protected,
and another involving a derivative work where no part of the work
could be protected. The general statement, when taken in the context
of the comparison of compilations and derivative works in the section
and the two examples given, is best understood as applying only to
compilations. Although it is not crystal clear, it appears that the
Committee assumed that in a derivative work the underlying work is
"employed" throughout.

Professor Nimmer also interprets the House Report language as
generally denying copyright protection to any portion of an
unauthorized derivative work. After setting forth some of the language
from the House Report regarding section 103(a) he states,

the effect [of section 103(a) ] generally would be to deny
copyright to derivative works, in which the pre-existing
work tends to pervade the entire derivative work, but not
to collective works, where the infringement arises from the
copying of the selection and arrangement of a number of

pre-existing works, and not per se from the reproduction
of any particular prior work.

1 M. Nimmer, § 3.06, pgs. 3–22.3 thru 3–22.4.

Like the House Report, Nimmer also preceded his conclusion that no
part of derivative work unlawfully employing preexisting material
should be copyrightable with a general statement that "only that
portion of a derivative or collective work which employs the pre-
existing work would be denied copyright". 1 M. Nimmer, § 3.06, pg.
3–22.3. At first blush, both Nimmer's and the Committee's language
are internally inconsistent. Both start with a general proposition that
only the portion of a work which unlawfully employs the prior work
should be denied copyright protection. Both then appear to conclude
that no part of an infringing derivative work should be granted
copyright protection. Only if a derivative work is assumed to employ
the infringing work throughout do these passages read coherently.

The case law interpreting section 103(a) also supports the conclusion
that generally no part of an infringing derivative work should be
granted copyright protection. In Eden Toys, Inc. v. Florelee
Undergarment Co., the circuit court dealt primarily with the question
of whether an authorized derivative work contained sufficient
originality to gain copyright protection. 697 F.2d 27, 34–35
(2d.Cir.1982). However, in dicta the court opined on what result
would be warranted if the derivative work had been made without the
permission of the original author. The Court cited to the
aforementioned passages from Professor Nimmer's treatise and the
House Report andassumed without discussion that the "derivative
copyrights would be invalid, since the preexisting illustration used
without permission would tend to pervade the entire work." Id. at 34
n. 6. In Gracen v. Bradford, the Seventh Circuit also dealt primarily
with whether plaintiff's derivative work had sufficient originality to
comply with requirements of section 103. 798 F.2d 300, 302–303
(7th Cir.1983).Gracen also discussed the issue of the copyrightability
of an unauthorized derivative work. The Court stated "if Miss Gracen

https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/collages/31817

Anderson v. Stallone, 11 USPQ2D 1161 (C.D. Cal. 1989)

72

had no authority to make derivative works from the movie, she could
not copyright the painting and drawings, and she infringed MGM's
copyright by displaying them publicly." Id. at 303. Once again, the
Circuit court assumed that no part of an unlawful derivative work
could be copyrighted.

Plaintiff has written a treatment which is an unauthorized derivative
work. This treatment infringes upon Stallone's copyrights and his
exclusive right to prepare derivative works which are based upon
these movies. 17 U.S.C. § 106(2). Section 103(a) was not intended
to arm an infringer and limit the applicability of section 106(2) on
unified derivative works. As the House Report and Professor Nimmer's
treatise explain, 103(a) was not intended to apply to derivative works
and most certainly was not an attempt to modify section 106(2).
Section 103(a) allows an author whose authorship essentially is the
arrangement or ordering of several independent works to keep the
copyright for his arrangement even if one of the underlying works he
arranged is found to be used unlawfully. The infringing portion would
be easily severable and the scope of the compilation author's own
work would be easily ascertainable. Even if this Court were to
interpret section 103(a) as allowing an author of an infringing
derivative work to sue third parties based on the non-infringing
portions of his work, section 106(2) most certainly precludes the
author of an unauthorized infringing derivative work from suing the
author of the work which he has already infringed. Thus, the Court
HOLDS that the defendants are entitled to summary judgment on
plaintiff's copyright claims as the plaintiff cannot gain copyright
protection for any portion of his work under section 103(a). In
addition, Anderson is precluded by section 106(2) from bringing an
action for copyright infringement against Stallone and the other
defendants.

B. Summary Judgment Is Appropriate On The
Copyright Claims Because Rocky IV Is Not
Substantially Similar To Anderson's

Treatment

1. Legal Framework

To prevail on his claim for copyright infringement, Mr. Anderson must
prove that he owns a copyright and his work was copied by the
defendant. Sid & Marty Krofft Television v. McDonalds Corp., 562
F.2d 1157, 1162 (9th Cir.1977). Because there is rarely direct
evidence that an alleged infringer physically copied a work, a
plaintiff need only show that the defendant had access to his work
and that the defendant's work is substantially similar to the plaintiff's
copyrighted work. Sid & Marty Krofft, 562 F.2d at 1162–63. (As an
aside, the Court notes that an alleged infringer also rarely has direct
irrefutable evidence—such as Stallone's press conferences describing
his ideas of an East/West boxing confrontation before receiving
Anderson's script—that he had independently developed the idea
which he allegedly copied from the defendant.) This Court has
already held that Anderson's work is not entitled to copyright
protection. See pgs. 12–24 supra. This finding alone necessitates that
the defendants be granted summary judgment on the copyright
infringement claims. However, even if this Court were to hold that
Anderson's work was entitled to copyright protection, defendants are
entitled to summary judgment on the grounds that the defendants did
not copy Anderson's work.

In this circuit, there is a two part test for determining whether an
allegedly infringing work is substantially similar to the copyright
holder's work. The first prong is referred to as the extrinsic test. Under
the extrinsic test, analytic dissection and expert testimony are
employed to determine whether there is substantial similarity of ideas
between the two works in question. Olson, 855 F.2d at
1449.Application of the extrinsic test to analyze whether a movie is
substantially similar to a script requires a court to compare the plot,
theme, dialogue, mood, setting, pace, sequence of events, and
characters of the two works. Berkic v. Crichton, 761 F.2d 1289, 1293
(9th Cir.1985),; Litchfield v. Spielberg, 736 F.2d 1352, 1356–57 (9th

https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/collages/31817

Page 17 of 29

Anderson v. Stallone, 11 USPQ2D 1161 (C.D. Cal. 1989)

5/7/17, 1:20 PM

78

79

Cir.1984). Since the extrinsic test relies on objective analytical criteria,
"this question may often be decided as a matter of law." Krofft, 562
F.2d at 1164.

The extrinsic prong of the Krofft test has been expanded by this circuit
so that the test actually goes beyond a determination of substantial
similarity of ideas. It is true that a theme or mood is merely an idea.
However, specific plot sequences, highly delineated characters, and
dialogue in a work can often constitute protectable expression. Thus,
the Krofft test as applied in Berkic and Litchfieldno longer fits neatly
into separate analyses of ideas and expression in two works as the
Courts analyzed expression under the extrinsic prong of the test.
Berkic, 761 F.2d at 1293–94, Litchfield, 736 F.2d at 1357. In any
event, it is the test that this Court applies in determining whether Rocky
IV is substantially similar to Anderson's treatment.

The second prong of the Krofft test for substantial similarity is referred
to as the intrinsic test. Under the intrinsic test, the plaintiff must show
that there is substantial similarity of expression between the two works
in question. The intrinsic test is subjective and is based on the response
of the audience to the look and feel of the two works. In this case, the
intrinsic test requires a determination of whether the ordinary
reasonable audience could recognize the movie Rocky IV as a
dramatization or picturization of Mr. Anderson's work. Berkic,761
F.2d at 1292; Litchfield, 736 F.2d at 1357.

At the summary judgment stage, Anderson must establish that a triable
issue of fact remains as to whether there is substantial similarity of both
ideas and expression. Berkic, 761 F.2d at 1292. This Court is
cognizant that summary judgment is not favored where there are
disputable factual issues that are best left to a jury. This problem is
greatest when the Court puts itself in the place of the reasonable
audience and evaluates the total look and feel of a work under the
intrinsic test. However, to grant summary judgment, this Court need
only find, after analyzing the two works under the objective factors
which comprise the extrinsic test, that there is no substantial similarity

https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/collages/31817

Page 18 of 29

Anderson v. Stallone, 11 USPQ2D 1161 (C.D. Cal. 1989)

5/7/17, 1:20 PM

under the extrinsic prong of the substantial similarity test of this circuit.
Plaintiff can only prevail on his infringement claim if he shows that
there is substantial similarity of both ideas and expression. Berkic, 761
F.2d at 1292, Litchfield, 736 F.2d at 1356, Krofft, 562 F.2d at 1164.

This circuit has upheld grants of summary judgment on the issue of
substantial similarity when the plaintiff's claims were much stronger
than those before this Court. Berkic, 761 F.2d 1289 (Ninth Circuit
affirmed grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant on issue of
substantial similarity of the movie Coma and plaintiff's treatment
although the court recognized that similarities existed between the
works); Litchfield, 736 F.2d 1352 (Ninth Circuit affirmed grant of
summary judgment in favor of defendant on issue of substantial
similarity between the movie E.T. and plaintiff's play in spite of
character and plot similarities); See v. Durang, 711 F.2d 141 (9th
Cir.1983) (Ninth Circuit affirmed grant of summary judgment for
defendant on copyright infringement claim, even thought it did find
that the two plays shared common ideas).

This circuit has also eliminated certain portions of works from
evaluation under the substantial similarity test. For example, "all
situations which flow naturally from a basic plot premise, so called
'scenes a faire,' " are not protected against copying. Berkic, 761 F.2d
at 1293.For example, any boxing movie, regardless of the source, will
contain fight scenes. It is also natural for any boxing movie,
regardless of the source, to depict the fighters training and preparing
for fights.

Nor do general plot themes or ideas receive any copyright protection.
Id. Nationalistic themes and themes, extolling the virtues of the
underdog are not protectable expression. Likewise, a basic idea such
as a symbolic struggle between a Russian and an American are not
protectable by copyright and are part of the general domain of ideas.

80

81

82

83

The unusual circumstances of this case also distinguish it from other
infringement cases and make a finding of non-infringement
appropriate. The first three Rocky movies were made before Anderson

https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/collages/31817

Page 19 of 29

Anderson v. Stallone, 11 USPQ2D 1161 (C.D. Cal. 1989)

5/7/17, 1:20 PM

wrote his treatment. Plaintiff concedes that he wrote his sequel after
viewing the movies. Thus, Anderson is precluded from basing any
inference of copying by Stallone in Rocky IV from similarities that flow
naturally from the fact that both works are sequels to the first three
movies. Second, it is uncontroverted that Stallone had already
developed the idea that Rocky IV would center around a symbolic
boxing confrontation between the United States and Russia before he
knew that plaintiff's treatment existed. Thus, any similarity in the two
works based on this symbolic confrontation cannot give rise to an
inference that Stallone appropriated this idea from Anderson. Third, it
is uncontroverted that it was the defendant, not the plaintiff, who
developed the majority of characters in plaintiff's work. These include:
Rocky, Adrian (Rocky's wife), Rocky, Jr. (Rocky's son), Paulie (Rocky's
brother-in-law), Apollo Creed, Duke (Creed's manager), and Clubber
Lang. Even if a court were to find that these characters were not
copyrightable, the fact that they originated with the defendant
precludes any finding of similarity based on this common element of
the two works.

2. Application Of The Krofft Test

A. Extrinsic Test

The extrinsic test requires a comparison of plot, theme, dialogue,
mood, setting, pace, sequence, and characters.

i. Plot—Rocky IV

In Rocky IV, Ivan Drago, a Russian fighter, arrives in the United States.
Drago and his wife hold a press conference where she announces
that Drago wants to fight professionally in the United States and
would like to fight Rocky Balboa, the retired world boxing champion.
Rocky is a wealthy ex-boxer and he declines to fight the dangerous
Drago. However, Rocky's friend, Apollo Creed, wants to come out of
retirement to fight Drago. Rocky, fearing for Apollo's health,
unsuccessfully tries to talk Apollo out of fighting Drago. Apollo fights
Drago in Las Vegas in a circus-like setting. Rocky is in Apollo's corner

91

during the fight. Apollo refuses to stop fighting, even though Drago is
injuring him during the early rounds of the fight. Drago strikes Apollo
after the bell with a vicious blow and kills him. Rocky gives the eulogy
at Apollo's funeral.

A fight between Rocky and Drago is announced. The fight is a non-
sanctioned fight and Rocky will be forced to give up his title to fight
Drago. Rocky will not take any prize money for the fight. Drago will
not fight in the United States as he fears for his safety after killing
Apollo. The fight will be held in Russia on Christmas day. Soviet
officials describe the fight as a test of the systems of the two countries.
Rocky's wife disapproves of the fight and is extremely upset over the
news of the fight.

Rocky travels to Siberia to train in isolated surroundings. He is
accompanied by Paulie, Duke, and two Soviet observers. Adrian also
comes to Siberia where they reconcile their differences. Rocky trains
by chopping wood, pulling sleds, running up mountains, shadow
boxing, and performing other basic exercises. These scenes are
juxtaposed with Drago's training. Drago trains in a technologically
advanced environment with specialized machines. He trains
surrounded by scientific advisors, and it is suggested that he is taking
performance enhancing drugs. Drago looks invincible as he appears
much larger and stronger than Rocky.

The fight takes place in Moscow. It is a brutal fifteen round fight.
Rocky takes a severe beating but refuses to go down. In the fourteenth
and fifteenth rounds, the Soviet crowd begins cheering Rocky's
heroism. Rocky wins the fight in the fifteenth round and is hoisted up
by the crowd. Rocky then gives an impassioned speech that
emphasizes that the United States and the Soviet Union are capable
of changing and getting along.

92

The Court also notes that Rocky IV is replete with scenes in which
Rocky has flashbacks to the first three Rocky movies.

93

ii. Anderson's Treatment

https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/collages/31817

97

Several scenes at the beginning of the treatment chronicle the
development from childhood of an East German boxer Adolph
Heinemann. He begins boxing in international competition by the age
of sixteen. He goes on to capture the gold medal at the 1984
Olympics. Heinemann then fights the heavyweight champion Clubber
Lang, at Madison Square Garden. Heinemann defeats Lang in the
first round. Rocky and Apollo Creed watch the fight from ringside.
They are partners in the fight promotion business.

Heinemann makes several successful defenses of his title in Eastern
Europe cities of Leningrad, Moscow, Leipzig, and East Berline. Due to
dominance of professional boxing by eastern block fighters, all major
fights take place in eastern block countries. Rocky and Apollo
continue their fight promotion business. Rocky and Apollo use their
own money to finance three days of boxing at Madison Square
Garden. They place their fortunes on the line to buy television
coverage. The main event pits Clubber Lang against an Irish fighter.
There is little interest in the event. Rocky and Apollo go broke. Rocky
sells all of his possessions to pay his creditors.

Rocky returns to the "row house apartment of Rocky I". (This setting is
appropriated from Stallone's first movie by Anderson) He goes to
work in a meat packing plant in Philadelphia. (This portion of the story
also borrows heavily from Rocky I.) A Soviet leader gives a speech to
the United Nations in New York. He states that the Communist world is
prevailing over the West as exemplified by their boxing champion. He
refers to Rocky as an old and weak ex-fighter. Upon hearing the
speech, Rocky and Apollo become very distraught.

Both Rocky and Apollo, unbeknownst to the other, regroup and begin
training in seclusion. Rocky is in Philadelphia and Apollo is in Los
Angeles. Thereafter, Rocky and Apollo simultaneously take planes to
visit the other and break the news of their respective
comebacks.Coincidentally, both are on planes which are stopping
over in Chicago. While in one of the terminals at the airport they
bump into each other. They decide to begin training together.

101

Rocky and Apollo return to the "old gym of original movie" (setting
and training scenes based upon Rocky I) and devise a secret strategy
for Rocky to beat Heinemann. An East German representative to the
United Nations informs Rocky that Heinemann will not fight him
because he is too old. Rocky and Apollo then go to New York to East
Germany's United Nations ambassador. They barge in the office and
intimidate the ambassador into calling Heinemann to ask him to fight
Rocky. Rocky insults Heinemann and convinces him to agree to a
fight.

To raise money for his training, Rocky fights in exhibitions in Europe
and South America. He fights in France, England, and Spain. He also
trains in a Parisian bordello and a London nunnery. In London, Rocky
is approached by CIA agents and followed by KGB officers. The CIA
offers to pay Rocky's training expenses and he refuses. Rocky runs
through a number of European capitals and ends up at St. Peters
Square in Rome on the day the Pope is to appear.

Rocky fights Heinemann at an outdoor stadium one hundred yards
east of the Berlin wall. Heinemann originally dominates the fight.
However, Rocky makes a heroic comeback and wins the fight when
Heinemann refuses to answer the bell in the sixth round. The East
German crowd cheers Rocky's victory.

A comparison of the two plots shows that they are dissimilar apart
from the East/West boxing confrontation that Stallone, himself,
developed. Plaintiff argues that the list of similarities compiled by his
expert Michael Roger precludes this Court from granting summary
judgment, no matter how dissimilar the plots appear to this Court.
However, this circuit has previously held that such lists of random
similarities are inherently subjective and unreliable and do not in and
of themselves create a material issue of fact. Litchfield, 736 F.2d at
1357. In his declaration, Mr. Rogers states that the plots are similar
because in both works a Communist fighter defeats an American and
subsequently Rocky defeats the Communist fighter and wins over a
Communist crowd. (Rogers Declaration, ¶ 4) However, Rogers'

https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/collages/31817

Page 23 of 29

Anderson v. Stallone, 11 USPQ2D 1161 (C.D. Cal. 1989)

5/7/17, 1:20 PM

declaration is deficient. As noted previously, Anderson cannot claim
that Stallone copied the idea of an East/West boxing confrontation
because there is uncontroverted evidence that Stallone developed the
idea independently. In addition, the general similarities cited by
Rogers between the plots and the themes of the two movies do not
create any material fact issue for this Court, as general themes and
basic plots are not protected by copyright. Litchfield, 736 F.2d at
1351.52; Jason v. Fonda, 526 F.Supp 774, 777 (C.D.Cal.1981).

102

Setting

103

The settings of the two movies are also quite different. In Anderson's
treatment Rocky is a promoter in New York. After losing his savings he
returns to where he lived in Philadelphia and Apollo returns to a gym
in Los Angeles. (These settings in Philadelphia and Los Angeles are
used in the first Rocky movies and are evidence that Anderson is
copying Stallone's settings from the earlier Rocky movies, not that
Stallone is copying the setting from Anderson's treatment.) In
Anderson's treatment, Heinemann grows up in East Germany. Rocky
trains in France, England, Spain, Germany, and Denmark. Rocky runs
through major cities in each of these countries. The settings for his
training include a bordello in Paris, a London nunnery, the Eiffel
tower, and St. Peters Square. The final fight between Rocky and
Heinemann takes place next to the Berlin wall in East Germany.

104

In Rocky IV, Apollo fights Drago in Las Vegas. Rocky trains in Siberia.
The final fight is set in Moscow.

105

Dialogue

106

Anderson's treatment contains very little dialogue as the treatment is a
brief thirty-one page storyline. In his papers before this Court,
Anderson did not claim that Rocky IV contained any dialogue similar
to that in his treatment. However, in a "surreply", submitted without
authorization by this Court, plaintiff's expert asserted that both works
contained a short propaganda speech by a Soviet official which were
very similar. This Court did not find a substantial similarity between

https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/collages/31817

Page 24 of 29

Anderson v. Stallone, 11 USPQ2D 1161 (C.D. Cal. 1989)

5/7/17, 1:20 PM

these two speeches or any portions of the dialogue of the two works.

107

Themes

108

A symbolic struggle between the United States and the eastern block
is the overriding theme of both movies. Once again, the Court notes
that there is uncontroverted evidence that Stallone developed this
theme independently. However, unlike Anderson's treatment, Rocky IV
ends with a speech in which he emphasizes the theme that the United
States and the Soviet Union should attempt to change their
adversarial relationship. No such theme of potential resolution of the
East/West conflict appears in Anderson's script.

109

Rocky IV also contains a number of other underlying themes that are
not found in Anderson's treatment. In Rocky IV, Rocky fights Drago to
exact revenge for Drago's killing of his friend. Also, Stallone
emphasizes that Rocky's old fashioned training can succeed against
highly sophisticated Soviet athletic training.

110

111

112

113

114

Both movies also share a nationalistic theme. However, this
nationalistic theme is also emphasized in Rocky I, II, and III and this
would be a necessary component of any sequel to the prior Rocky
movies.

Sequence

The only similarity in the sequencing of the two works is that both end
with Rocky fighting a communist fighter. However, Stallone had
originally emphasized that the climax of his movie would be a fight
between Rocky and a Russian fighter.

Tone and Mood

Anderson did not claim that the tone and mood of the two movies
were similar until this deficiency was pointed out by the defendants
and he filed an unauthorized surreply. This Court finds it difficult to
determine the tone and mood of Anderson's work due to its brevity
and the lack of dialogue. This Court finds the tone and mood of Rocky

https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/collages/31817

Page 25 of 29

Anderson v. Stallone, 11 USPQ2D 1161 (C.D. Cal. 1989)

5/7/17, 1:20 PM

IV to be very similar to that of the prior Rocky movies developed by
Stallone. All of the Rocky movies are nationalistic, upbeat movies
laced with occasional bits of humor, and involving Rocky Balboa in
some new challenge. Whether these qualities could be extrapolated
from Anderson's treatment is of little consequence, as the sequel
Rocky IV shares the same tone and mood as the prior Rocky movies
that were created by Stallone.

115

116

117

118

Characters

Rocky IV features the following characters: Rocky, Adrian (Rocky's
wife), Rocky, Jr. (Rocky's son), Paulie (Rocky's brother-in-law), Apollo
Creed, Duke (Creed's manager), Clubber Lang, Ivan Drago (Soviet
boxer), Ludmilla (Drago's wife/spokeswoman), and Nicolai Koloff
(Drago's manager).

Anderson's treatment features the following characters: Rocky, Adrian,
Rocky, Jr., Paulie, Apollo Creed, Duke, Clubber Lang, Adolph
Heinemann (East German boxer), and an unnamed Soviet
propaganda expert.

As can be seen from above, the majority of characters used in
Anderson's treatment were created by Stallone. As noted throughout
this opinion, these characters cannot be the basis for any finding of
substantial similarity between Anderson and Stallone's work for
purposes of establishing infringement. However, Anderson created
two characters in his treatment that serve the same function as two of
the characters from Rocky IV. Anderson's Adolph Heinemann and
Stallone's Ivan Drago play similar roles as do Anderson's unnamed
Soviet progaganda expert and Nicolai Koloff.

119

Both Heinemann and Drago are large powerful boxers from the
eastern block being used as propaganda tools in the boxing arena.
Both are bigger than Rocky and favored to win their fights with him.
However, this similarity is not a basis for inferring that Stallone copied
Anderson's treatment, because in all of Rocky's previous fights he was
the underdog to a physically superior opponent. In addition,

https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/collages/31817

Page 26 of 29

Anderson v. Stallone, 11 USPQ2D 1161 (C.D. Cal. 1989)

5/7/17, 1:20 PM

120

121

Stallone's original plot ideas necessitated that he create a Soviet
boxer. Heinemann is not described in great detail in Anderson's script
although he is referred to as an "Aryan German". In Rocky IV, Drago
is blond and has blue eyes.

Likewise, Anderson's unnamed propaganda official is not well
developed. In fact, he appears in only two scenes in the treatment.
Apparently, this official is the mastermind of the plan to create a
Communist world boxing champion. On the other hand, Stallone's
Nicolai Koloff is Drago's manager who appears at all the press
conferences and is partially responsible for Drago's training. Koloff
plays a different and more prominent role than the unnamed
propaganda official. In addition, neither Heinemann nor the
propaganda official are delineated with greater specificity in
Anderson's treatment.

As delineated above, Anderson cannot base a finding of substantial
similarity on the characters and themes that Stallone had developed
previously. Nor can a finding of substantial similarity be based on the
fact that the two works both culminate in a symbolic boxing
confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union. This
symbolic confrontation was developed independently by Stallone.
When the two works are compared without considering Stallone's
own characters and themes, it is abundantly clear that the plot, setting
and sequence of events are very dissimilar. Most of the characters in
Anderson's works were appropriated from Stallone. The two
characters that Anderson created independently, Heinemann and the
Soviet propaganda expert, are not highly delineated. Nor are they
substantially similar to Drago or Koloff, the two parallel characters in
Stallone's treatment. These character similarities cannot be the basis
for a finding of substantial similarity. See Olson, 855 F.2d at 1451–
53 (Substantial similarity cannot be based on loose similarity
between plaintiff's thinly sketched character and defendant's
allegedly infringing characters.) Nor can the common ideas and
themes that plaintiff alleges to exist between the two works be a basis
for a finding of substantial similarity, as these general themes are not

protectable expression. Berkic, 761 F.2d at 1293. Based upon an
analysis of the objective criteria above, the Court holds that under the
extrinsic test the two works are dissimilar.

122

This Court need not reach the question of whether there is substantial
similarity between the two works under the intrinsic test because it has
ruled as a matter of law that the two works are dissimilar under the
extrinsic prong of this circuit's test for substantial similarity. Berkic, 761
F.2d at 1292; Litchfield, 736 F.2d at 1356; Krofft, 562 F.2d at 1164.
This conclusion follows logically as it would be incongruous for a
court to find as a matter of law that the two works are based on
dissimilar ideas and then find that a material issue of fact remains as
to whether the higher threshold of substantial similarity of expression
exists between the two works.

B. Intrinsic Test

124

In any event, the Court finds that no reasonable audience would
recognize the movie Rocky IV as a dramatization or picturization of
Anderson's work. Under the intrinsic test as well as under the extrinsic
test, a finding of substantial similarity cannot be based on
unprotectable scenes-a-faire or characters, themes, and plots which
Stallone originally created himself. Aliotti v. R. Dakin & Co., 831 F.2d
898, 901 (9th Cir.1987), Berkic, 761 F.2d at 1293. Taking away
these portions of Anderson's work, no reasonable jury could find that
Rocky IV is a picturization of Anderson's treatment. This necessitates a
holding that the two works are dissimilar as a matter of law under the
intrinsic test. Berkic, 761 F.2d at 1292, Litchfield, 736 F.2d at 1357.

125

The Court finds that Rocky IV is not substantially similar to Anderson's
work. Nor is any portion of Anderson's work entitled to copyright
protection under 17 U.S.C. sections 103(a) & 106(2). The Court
GRANTS defendants summary judgment on Anderson's claim that
they infringed Anderson's copyright.
